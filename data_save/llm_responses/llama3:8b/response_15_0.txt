Here are the rules:\n\n```\nd3(X) :- not d1(X), not d2(X).\nd1(X) :- d0(X), not d3(X).\nd2(X) :- d1(X), not d3(X).\nd1(X) :- d2(X), not d3(X).  % This rule is not strictly necessary, but it's included for completeness.\nd0(X) :- not d1(X), not d2(X), not d3(X).\n```\n\nThese rules are minimal in the sense that they can generate all possible solutions (stable models) without introducing unnecessary redundancy or contradictions.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of each rule:\n\n* `d3(X) :- not d1(X), not d2(X).`: If `X` is not assigned by `d1` or `d2`, then it's assigned by `d3`.\n* `d1(X) :- d0(X), not d3(X).`: If `X` is assigned by `d0`, and it's not assigned by `d3`, then it's assigned by `d1`.\n* `d2(X) :- d1(X), not d3(X).`: If `X` is assigned by `d1`, and it's not assigned by `d3`, then it's assigned by `d2`.\n* `d0(X) :- not d1(X), not d2(X), not d3(X).`: If `X` is not assigned by any of the other predicates, then it's assigned by `d0`.\n\nThese rules can generate all possible solutions (stable models) that satisfy the given facts.",
