However, it's necessary to prevent `d1(o1)` from being inferred twice.\n* `d0(o3)` is a standalone fact that can't be deduced from other predicates.\n\n**Minimal set of rules:**\n\nHere are the minimal rules that lead to the stable model:\n\n```\nd2(X) :- d1(X), not d3(X).  % prevents double inference of d1(o1)\nd3(o1).\nd0(o3).\n```\n\nThese rules ensure that `d3(o1)` is inferred only once, and `d2(o1)` is necessary to prevent multiple inferences of `d1(o1)`. The standalone fact `d0(o3)` remains unchanged.",
