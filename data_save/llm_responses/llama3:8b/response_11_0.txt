    "content": "A nice ASP problem!\n\nAfter analyzing the stable model and the given facts, I've deduced a minimal set of rules that can lead to this stable model. Here are the rules:\n\n```\nd3(o1) :- d1(o1), not d2(o1).\nd0(o1).\nd2(X) :- d1(X).\nd3(o3) :- d2(o3).\nd2(o2).\nd2(o4).\n```\n\nLet me explain each rule:\n\n* `d3(o1) :- d1(o1), not d2(o1).`: This rule states that if `o1` has a `d1` fact and doesn't have a `d2` fact, then it must have a `d3` fact. This is necessary to satisfy the stable model.\n* `d0(o1).`: A constant rule for `o1`, as there's no other information about this object in the facts.\n* `d2(X) :- d1(X).`: This rule states that if an object has a `d1` fact, then it must also have a `d2` fact. This is necessary to satisfy the stable model and ensure that all `d1` objects are also `d2` objects.\n* `d3(o3) :- d2(o3).`: Similar to the previous rule, this states that if an object has a `d2` fact, then it must have a `d3` fact. This is necessary to satisfy the stable model and ensure that all `d2` objects are also `d3` objects.\n* The remaining rules are just facts: `d2(o2)`, `d2(o4)`.\n\nThese rules, along with the given facts, should lead to the same stable model as before.",
