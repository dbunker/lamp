    "content": "A nice ASP problem!\n\nAfter analyzing the facts and the stable model, I was able to deduce the following rules:\n\n```\n:- not d4(o1).\nd3(X) :- d0(Y), X \\= Y.\nd2(X) :- d3(Y), X \\= Y.\n```\n\nHere's how I arrived at these rules:\n\n1. `d4(o1)` is true, so we need to ensure that `o1` has no other outgoing `d4` edges. This is achieved by the rule `:- not d4(o1).`, which prevents any new `d4` edges from being created.\n2. `d3(o3)` and `d3(o1)` are both true, so we need to ensure that `o0` has no outgoing `d3` edge. This is achieved by the rule `d3(X) :- d0(Y), X \\= Y.` , which says that if there's a `d0` edge from some node `Y`, then there can't be a `d3` edge to any other node `X`.\n3. `d2(o1)` is true, so we need to ensure that `o1` has no other outgoing `d2` edges. This is not explicitly needed in the rules, but it's implied by the previous two rules.\n\nNote that these rules are minimal in the sense that they only introduce new predicates and do not introduce any redundant or unnecessary constraints.",
