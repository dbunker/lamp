Here are the rules:\n\n```\nd0(X) :- not d1(X), not d2(X), not d3(X), not d4(X). % ensures X is not in d1, d2, d3, or d4\nd1(o3).\nd2(o3).\nd2(o2).\nd4(o1).\n```\n\nThese rules will produce the desired stable model:\n\n`d1(o3)`, `d2(o3)`, `d2(o2)`, and `d4(o1)`.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of each rule:\n\n* The first rule, `d0(X) :- not d1(X), not d2(X), not d3(X), not d4(X)`, ensures that any atom not covered by the other rules is assigned to `d0`. This is because `d0` is the default predicate when no other predicate applies.\n* The remaining four rules are just facts, stating that specific atoms belong to their respective predicates.\n\nThese rules, together with the given facts, will produce the desired stable model.",
