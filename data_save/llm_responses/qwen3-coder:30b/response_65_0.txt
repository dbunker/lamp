Looking at what's in the stable model:\n- d4(o2) and d4(o0) must be derived from d0(o2), d0(o0), d2(o3), d3(o3)\n- d1(o3) must be derived from d3(o3)\n\nActually, let me think about this more systematically. \n\nThe most straightforward interpretation is:\n```\nd4(X) :- d0(X).\nd1(X) :- d3(X).\n```\n\nBut this wouldn't generate d4(o2) from d2(o3). \n\nLooking more carefully at the stable model, I need rules that can derive the new facts:\n- d4(o2) and d4(o0) - these need to be derived from existing facts\n- d1(o3) - this needs to be derived from d3(o3)\n\nThe minimal rules are:\n```\nd4(X) :- d0(X), d2(X), d3(X).\nd1(X) :- d3(X).\n```",
