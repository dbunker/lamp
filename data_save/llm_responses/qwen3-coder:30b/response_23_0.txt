    "content": "Looking at the given facts and stable model, I need to deduce the minimal set of rules that would generate this result.\n\nGiven facts:\n- d4(o3)\n- d1(o3) \n- d0(o4)\n- d3(o1)\n\nStable model result:\n- d0(o4)\n- d1(o3)\n- d1(o1)\n- d4(o3)\n- d4(o4)\n- d3(o1)\n\nLet me analyze what rules could generate these conclusions:\n\nFrom the stable model, I can see that:\n1. d1(o1) appears in the model but not in the original facts - it must be derived\n2. d4(o4) appears in the model but not in the original facts - it must be derived\n3. All other atoms appear in both facts and model\n\nThe key derivations are:\n- d1(o1) must be derived from some rule involving d1, d2, etc.\n- d4(o4) must be derived from some rule involving d4, d2, etc.\n\nLooking at the pattern, the minimal rules that could generate this are:\n\nd1(o1) :- d3(o1), not d2(o1).\nd4(o4) :- d0(o4), not d2(o4).\n\nWait, let me reconsider more systematically. Since we have d0(o4) in facts and d4(o4) in model, and d3(o1) in facts and d1(o1) in model, the rules must be:\n\nd1(o1) :- d3(o1), not d2(o1).\nd4(o4) :- d0(o4), not d2(o4).\n\nActually, looking more carefully, we need rules that can generate the missing atoms. Since d1(o1) and d4(o4) are in the stable model but not in the facts, they must be generated by rules.\n\nThe minimal set of rules is:\n\nd1(o1) :- d3(o1).\nd4(o4) :- d0(o4).",
