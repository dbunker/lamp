    "content": "Looking at the given facts and stable model, I need to deduce the minimal set of rules that would generate this result.\n\nGiven facts:\n- d2(o0). d1(o0). d2(o1). d3(o1)\n\nStable model result:\n- d2(o0) d2(o1) d1(o0) d0(o0) d3(o1)\n\nLet me analyze what rules are needed:\n\n1. For d2(o0) and d2(o1) to appear in the model, there must be rules that derive these facts\n2. For d1(o0) to appear, either it's in facts or derived by a rule\n3. For d0(o0) to appear, there must be a rule that derives it\n4. For d3(o1) to appear, either it's in facts or derived by a rule\n\nSince d1(o0) and d3(o1) are in the original facts, they don't need rules. But d0(o0) appears in the model but not in the facts, so there must be a rule for it.\n\nLooking at the pattern, I can deduce these minimal rules:\n\n```\nd0(X) :- d1(X).\nd2(X) :- d2(X), not d0(X).\nd2(X) :- d3(X).\nd3(X) :- d3(X), not d0(X).\n```\n\nWait, let me reconsider more carefully. The stable model contains d0(o0), which is not in the original facts, so there must be a rule that derives it.\n\nThe minimal rules needed are:\n\n```\nd0(X) :- d1(X).\nd2(X) :- d2(X), not d0(X).\nd2(X) :- d3(X).\n```",
