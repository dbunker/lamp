Since d3(o2) appears in the stable model but not in the original facts, and d0(o2) and d4(o2) are both facts, a rule like:\n```\nd3(X) :- d0(X), d4(X).\n```\nwould derive d3(o2) from the facts d0(o2) and d4(o2).\n\nHowever, looking at the stable model more carefully, I notice d0(o0) and d0(o2) are both in the facts and result, and d4(o2) is in facts and result. The key derivation is d3(o2) which requires a rule.\n\n```\nd3(X) :- d0(X), d4(X).\n```",
