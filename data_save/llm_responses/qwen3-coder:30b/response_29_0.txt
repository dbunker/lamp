From d0(o0) in facts, and d0(o0) in result - this suggests d0(X) can be derived from itself or some rule\n2. From d3(o1) and d3(o2) in facts, and these appear in result - these are base facts\n3. d1(o1) and d1(o2) appear in result but not in facts - these must be derived\n4. d2(o1) appears in both facts and result - this is a base fact\n5. d2(o0) appears in result but not in facts - this must be derived\n\nLooking at the pattern, I can see that:\n- d1(X) seems to be derived from d3(X) (since d3(o1) and d3(o2) lead to d1(o1) and d1(o2))\n- d2(X) seems to be derived from d0(X) (since d0(o0) leads to d2(o0))\n\nThe minimal rules needed are:\n\nd1(X) :- d3(X).\nd2(X) :- d0(X).",
