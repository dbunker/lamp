    "content": "Looking at the given facts and stable model, I need to deduce the minimal set of rules that would generate the result.\n\nGiven facts:\n- d2(o0)\n- d3(o2) \n- d3(o1)\n- d3(o4)\n\nStable model result:\n- d2(o0)\n- d3(o2)\n- d3(o1)\n- d3(o4)\n- d1(o0)\n\nSince d1(o0) appears in the stable model but not in the original facts, it must be derived from rules. The minimal set of rules that would generate this result is:\n\nd1(X) :- d2(X).\nd1(X) :- d3(X).\n\nThese rules are minimal because:\n1. d1(o0) is derived from d2(o0) \n2. d1(o1), d1(o2), d1(o4) are derived from d3(o1), d3(o2), d3(o4) respectively\n\nHowever, looking more carefully at what's needed - since we want the minimal set that produces exactly the stable model, and we have d1(o0) in the final model, we need a rule that derives d1(o0) from d2(o0).\n\nThe minimal rules are:\n\nd1(X) :- d2(X).\nd1(X) :- d3(X).",
