    "content": "Looking at the given facts and stable model, I need to deduce the minimal set of rules that would generate this result.\n\nGiven facts:\n- d0(o1)\n- d3(o2) \n- d2(o2)\n- d4(o1)\n\nStable model result:\n- d4(o1)\n- d3(o2)\n- d1(o1)\n- d0(o1)\n- d2(o2)\n\nLet me analyze what rules would be needed:\n\n1. For d4(o1) to be true in the stable model, there must be a rule that derives it\n2. For d3(o2) to be true in the stable model, there must be a rule that derives it\n3. For d1(o1) to be true in the stable model, there must be a rule that derives it\n4. For d0(o1) to be true in the stable model, it's already given as a fact\n5. For d2(o2) to be true in the stable model, it's already given as a fact\n\nSince d0(o1) and d2(o2) are facts in the original set, they don't need rules to be derived.\n\nThe key insight is that we need rules that can derive d1(o1) and d3(o2) from the given facts, and ensure d4(o1) is derived.\n\nLooking at the stable model, I can see that:\n- d1(o1) must be derived from d0(o1) (since d0(o1) is given)\n- d3(o2) must be derived from d2(o2) (since d2(o2) is given)\n- d4(o1) must be derived from d3(o2) (since d3(o2) is given)\n\nThe minimal rules would be:\n- d1(X) :- d0(X).\n- d3(X) :- d2(X).  \n- d4(X) :- d3(X).\n\nHowever, looking more carefully, I need to ensure that the stable model is exactly what we see. The simplest approach is:\n\n```\nd1(X) :- d0(X).\nd3(X) :- d2(X).\nd4(X) :- d3(X).\n```",
