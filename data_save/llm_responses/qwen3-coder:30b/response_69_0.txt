The stable model includes d0(o1) which is in the facts, so no rule needed for that\n3. d4(o3) is in both facts and stable model, so no rule needed for that\n\nLooking at the pattern, I need rules that can generate:\n- d3(o1) from some condition\n- d2(o1) from some condition\n\nThe most minimal rules that could work:\n\n```\nd3(X) :- d2(X).\nd2(X) :- d0(X).\n```\n\nWait, let me reconsider more carefully. \n\nSince d0(o1) is given as a fact, and we want d2(o1) and d3(o1) to be in the stable model, the rules must be:\n\n```\nd2(X) :- d0(X).\nd3(X) :- d2(X).\n```\n\nThis would generate:\n- From d0(o1): d2(o1) \n- From d2(o1): d3(o1)\n\nThe other facts d3(o3), d4(o3), d2(o3) are already given as facts, so no rules needed for those.\n\n```\nd2(X) :- d0(X).\nd3(X) :- d2(X).\n```",
