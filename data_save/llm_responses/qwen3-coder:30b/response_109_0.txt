Looking at the pattern and the fact that d2(o1) is given, a possible rule could be:\n- d4(X) :- d2(X)\n\nLet me check if there are other rules needed:\n- d3(o1) and d3(o3) are in facts, so no rules needed\n- d1(o0) is in facts, so no rules needed\n- d2(o1) is in facts, so no rules needed\n\nThe minimal set of rules that would generate this stable model is:\n\nd4(X) :- d2(X).",
