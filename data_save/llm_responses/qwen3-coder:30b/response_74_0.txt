For d0(o0) to appear in the model, there must be a rule that derives it\n2. The facts d3(o0) and d3(o1) are already given, so d3 predicates are directly true\n3. The facts d2(o2) and d2(o1) are already given, so d2 predicates are directly true\n\nSince d0(o0) appears in the stable model but isn't in the original facts, there must be a rule that derives it. The most straightforward rule would be:\nd0(X) :- d3(X).\n\nBut I also need to check if there are any negation conditions. Looking at the stable model, d0(o0) appears, so there's no negation preventing it.\n\nThe minimal set of rules needed:\n- d0(X) :- d3(X).\n- d1(X) :- d2(X).\n- d2(X) :- d2(X). [This would be redundant]\n\nActually, looking more carefully, I need to think about what rules would generate the stable model from the facts.\n\nThe simplest rules that would work:\n- d0(X) :- d3(X).\n- d1(X) :- d2(X).\n\nBut wait, let me reconsider. The stable model shows d0(o0) is true, and we have d3(o0) in the facts, so:\nd0(o0) :- d3(o0).\n\nHowever, since we want minimal rules, and we know d3(o0) is given, we need a rule that can derive d0(o0) from d3(o0).\n\nLooking at the pattern, the minimal rules are:\nd0(X) :- d3(X).\nd1(X) :- d2(X).",
