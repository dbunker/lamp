The facts d2(o0), d3(o0), d0(o3), d2(o1) are given\n2. The stable model includes d3(o1) which is not in the original facts\n3. For d3(o1) to be derived, there must be a rule that generates it\n\nSince we're looking for minimal rules and the stable model includes d3(o1), there must be a rule that derives d3(X) from some other predicate.\n\nLooking at the pattern and the fact that d2(o1) is in the facts and d2(o1) is in the stable model, it seems like there might be a rule like:\n- d3(X) :- d2(X)\n\nBut let me reconsider more carefully. \n\nActually, looking at what's needed to generate d3(o1) from the given facts:\n- We have d2(o1) in the facts\n- We need d3(o1) in the stable model\n- This suggests a rule: d3(X) :- d2(X)\n\nChecking if this is sufficient:\n- d2(o0) exists \u2192 d3(o0) would be derived (but d3(o0) is already in the stable model)\n- d2(o1) exists \u2192 d3(o1) would be derived (and d3(o1) is in the stable model)\n\nSo the minimal rule would be:\nd3(X) :- d2(X)\n\nThis would generate d3(o0) and d3(o1) from the existing d2 facts, which matches the stable model.\n\nHowever, I should also consider if there are other rules needed. Looking at the stable model, all the d0 and d2 facts are already given, so no additional rules are needed for those.\n\nThe minimal set of rules is:\n\nd3(X) :- d2(X)",
