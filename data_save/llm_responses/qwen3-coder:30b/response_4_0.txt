Looking at the stable model, I need to determine which rules would actually be needed to generate the final result from the initial facts.\n\nActually, let me think about this systematically:\n- d0(o0) must be derived from d1(o0) (since d1(o0) is in facts)\n- d3(o0) must be derived from d2(o0) or some other rule\n\nLooking more carefully at what's needed:\n- d0(o0) must be derivable from d1(o0) \n- d3(o0) must be derivable from d2(o3) or some other rule\n\nThe minimal rules are:\n\nd0(X) :- d1(X).\nd3(X) :- d2(X).",
