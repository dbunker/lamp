From d2(o0) in facts, we need a rule that generates d4(o0) from d2(o0)\n2. From d1(o1) and d1(o3) in facts, we need rules that generate d4(o1) and d4(o3) \n3. d0(o0) is already in the facts, so we need a rule that generates d4(o0) from d0(o0)\n\nLooking at the pattern, it appears that:\n- d4(X) is generated from d2(X) \n- d4(X) is generated from d1(X)\n- d4(X) is generated from d0(X)\n\nSo the minimal rules would be:\n```\nd4(X) :- d2(X).\nd4(X) :- d1(X).  \nd4(X) :- d0(X).\n```",
