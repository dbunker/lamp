    "content": "Looking at the given facts and stable model, I need to deduce the minimal set of rules that would generate this result.\n\nGiven facts:\n- d3(o1)\n- d4(o2) \n- d2(o1)\n- d1(o2)\n\nStable model result:\n- d1(o2)\n- d3(o1)\n- d3(o2)\n- d4(o2)\n- d2(o1)\n\nLet me analyze what rules would be needed:\n\n1. For d1(o2) to be true in the model, there must be a rule that derives it\n2. For d3(o1) to be true, there must be a rule that derives it\n3. For d3(o2) to be true, there must be a rule that derives it\n4. For d4(o2) to be true, there must be a rule that derives it\n5. For d2(o1) to be true, there must be a rule that derives it\n\nSince we start with facts d3(o1), d4(o2), d2(o1), d1(o2), and these all appear in the stable model, the rules must be such that:\n- d1(o2) is derivable from the facts (likely from a rule like d1(X) :- d1(X))\n- d3(o1) is derivable from the facts (likely from a rule like d3(X) :- d3(X))\n- d3(o2) is derivable from the facts (likely from a rule like d3(X) :- d4(X) or similar)\n- d4(o2) is derivable from the facts (likely from a rule like d4(X) :- d4(X))\n- d2(o1) is derivable from the facts (likely from a rule like d2(X) :- d2(X))\n\nBut since we want minimal rules, and the facts are already present, the simplest approach is that each predicate is derived from itself or from the original facts.\n\nLooking more carefully at the stable model, the most minimal set of rules that would generate these results is:\n\n```\nd1(X) :- d1(X).\nd2(X) :- d2(X).\nd3(X) :- d3(X).\nd4(X) :- d4(X).\n```",
