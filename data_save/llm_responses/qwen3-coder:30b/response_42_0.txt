The most natural interpretation is that there are rules of the form:\n\n- d1(X) :- d0(X). (if d0 holds, then d1 holds)\n- d1(X) :- d4(X). (if d4 holds, then d1 holds)\n\nBut looking more carefully, since d1(o1) is already given, and we have d0(o1), we could have d1(X) :- d0(X).\n\nHowever, since d1(o4) and d1(o2) appear in the final model but not in initial facts, and we have d4(o4) and d4(o2) in facts, the most direct rule would be:\nd1(X) :- d4(X).\n\nBut we also need to consider that d1(o1) is in the stable model and d0(o1) is a fact, so we might have:\nd1(X) :- d0(X).\n\nLet me reconsider - the minimal set of rules that would generate the stable model:\n\n```\nd1(X) :- d0(X).\nd1(X) :- d4(X).\n```",
