The stable model includes d2(o2) which is not in the original facts, so there must be a rule that derives d2(o2)\n2. All the facts d0(o1), d3(o2), d1(o1), d2(o0) appear in the stable model, so they must either be facts or derived by rules\n3. The rule must be minimal - no redundant rules\n\nLooking at the pattern, it seems like:\n- d0(o1) and d1(o1) are facts\n- d3(o2) is a fact  \n- d2(o0) is a fact\n- d2(o2) must be derived from some rule\n\nThe simplest rule that could generate d2(o2) is:\nd2(X) :- d3(X).\n\nLet me verify this works:\n- If d3(o2) is true (it is a fact), then d2(o2) would be derived\n- All other facts remain as they are\n- This generates exactly the stable model shown\n\nThe minimal set of rules is:\n\nd2(X) :- d3(X).",
