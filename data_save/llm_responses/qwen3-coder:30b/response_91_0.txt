The stable model includes d1(o1) and d2(o1) from the facts\n3. d3(o4) and d4(o4) are in both facts and stable model\n\nThe minimal rules that would generate this stable model are:\n\n```\nd1(X) :- d2(X).\nd1(X) :- d3(X).\nd2(X) :- d1(X).\nd3(X) :- d4(X).\n```\n\nWait, let me reconsider this more carefully. Looking at the stable model, I need to determine what rules actually produce the derivations.\n\nSince d1(o4) appears in the stable model but not in the facts, it must be derived. The simplest rule that could derive it is:\n```\nd1(X) :- d3(X).\n```\n\nBut I also need to consider that d2(o1) is in the facts and appears in the stable model, and d1(o1) is in the facts and appears in the stable model.\n\nLooking more systematically, the minimal set of rules that would produce this stable model is:\n\n```\nd1(X) :- d3(X).\nd1(X) :- d2(X).\nd3(X) :- d4(X).\n```",
