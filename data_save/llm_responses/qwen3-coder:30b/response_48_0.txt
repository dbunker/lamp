Since d0(o1) appears in the result but not in the facts, there must be a rule that derives it\n2. Since d2(o1) appears in both facts and result, it's directly derived\n3. Since d0(o3) appears in both facts and result, it's directly derived\n4. Since d3(o0) and d3(o2) appear in both, they're directly derived\n\nLooking at the pattern, I need rules that can generate the missing facts:\n- d0(o1) must be derivable from some other predicates\n- The simplest rule would be something like: d0(X) :- d2(X) or d0(X) :- d3(X) etc.\n\nSince d2(o1) is given as a fact, and we want to generate d0(o1), a rule like:\nd0(X) :- d2(X) would work.\n\nBut let me check if we can derive d0(o1) from the facts:\n- We have d2(o1) as a fact\n- If we have d0(X) :- d2(X), then d0(o1) would be derived\n\nLet me also check d0(o3):\n- We have d0(o3) as a fact, so no rule needed for this one\n\nFor d3(o0) and d3(o2), they're facts so no rules needed.\n\nThe minimal rules that would generate this stable model are:\n\nd0(X) :- d2(X).\nd0(X) :- d3(X).",
