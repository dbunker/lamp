Looking at the pattern, the simplest rules that would work are:\n\nd0(X) :- d3(X).\nd1(X) :- d1(X). [This is redundant - already in facts]\nd2(X) :- d2(X). [This is redundant - already in facts]\n\nActually, since d1(o4) and d2(o2) are in the stable model and were in the facts, and d0(o3), d0(o1) are generated from d3(o3), d3(o1), the minimal rules are:\n\nd0(X) :- d3(X).\nd1(X) :- d1(X).\nd2(X) :- d2(X).\n\nBut since d1 and d2 are already facts, and d0 is derived from d3, the minimal set is:\n\nd0(X) :- d3(X).",
