(if d2(o0) leads to d1(o0))\n2. d1(o0) :- d0(o1), not d3(o1). (if d0(o1) and not d3(o1) leads to d1(o0))\n3. d1(o0) :- d4(o1), not d0(o1). (if d4(o1) and not d0(o1) leads to d1(o0))\n\nBut looking more carefully, since d1(o0) appears in the stable model but not in the facts, it must be derived by some rule. The simplest approach is to find rules that would generate exactly what we see.\n\nSince d1(o0) is the only predicate not in the original facts, and it appears in the stable model, the minimal rules are likely:\n\n```\nd1(o0) :- d2(o0).\nd1(o0) :- d0(o1), not d3(o1).\nd1(o0) :- d4(o1), not d0(o1).\n```\n\nBut this seems overly complex. Let me reconsider - since we want the minimal set and we know d1(o0) must be derived from the other facts, the simplest rule would be:\n\n```\nd1(o0) :- d2(o0).\n```",
