Since d0(o1) appears in the final model but not in the original facts, there must be a rule like:\n   d0(o1) :- some conditions\n\n2. Looking at the pattern, if we have d3(o1) and d4(o1) in the facts, and d0(o1) in the model, there might be rules like:\n   - d0(X) :- d3(X) \n   - d0(X) :- d4(X)\n\n3. But we also have d0(o2) in both facts and model, so that might be direct.\n\nLet me check if the minimal set of rules is:\n- d0(X) :- d3(X)\n- d0(X) :- d4(X)\n\nThis would derive d0(o1) from d3(o1) and d0(o1) from d4(o1).\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the original facts, I notice that d0(o2) is already present, so we don't need a rule to derive that.\n\nThe minimal set of rules that would generate the stable model is:\n\nd0(X) :- d3(X).\nd0(X) :- d4(X).",
