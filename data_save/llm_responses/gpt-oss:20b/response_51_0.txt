    "thinking": "We need to parse problem. We have facts: d3(o0). d1(o3). d2(o1). d2(o0). So facts: predicate d3 with argument o0; d1 with o3; d2 with o1; d2 with o0.\n\nWe have stable model: d3(o0) d1(o3) d1(o0) d0(o3) d0(o0) d2(o1) d2(o0).\n\nSo derived facts: d1(o0) and d0(o3), d0(o0). Note d1(o3) originally present, d3(o0) present. d2(o1) and d2(o0) present.\n\nWe need to deduce minimal set of rules that produce this stable model from the facts. Each rule of form predicate_0(X) :- predicate_1(X), not predicate_2(X), etc. So body can have positive and negative literals. The goal: find minimal set of rules that when applied to initial facts produce the stable model. Each predicate can be one of [d0, d1, d2, etc.]. We need to output rules as final lines of output. We need to produce minimal set of rules. We should guess possible rules: maybe d1(X) :- d3(X). So d3(o0) yields d1(o0). But d1(o3) already there. d0(o3) maybe d0(X) :- d1(X). Since d1(o3) gives d0(o3). d0(o0) maybe d0(X) :- d2(X). d2(o0) gives d0(o0). Or maybe d0(o0) from d2(o0). Or rule: d0(X) :- d2(X). That covers both d2(o0) and d2(o1). But d0(o1) is not present, but that rule would generate d0(o1) which we don't want. So rule must produce d0(o0) only, not d0(o1). So maybe d0(X) :- d2(X), not d1(X). That would give d0(o0) because d2(o0) true, d1(o0) derived later but maybe negative? But stable model: d1(o0) is true, but rule uses not d1(X), so cannot produce d0(o0) if d1(o0) is true. But stable model includes d1(o0) so that rule would fail to produce d0(o0). So not that.\n\nAlternate: d0(o0) rule maybe d0(X) :- d3(X). Since d3(o0) gives d0(o0). But that would also produce d0(o3) if d3(o3) existed but not. So rule d0(X) :- d3(X). That yields d0(o0). Also rule d0(X) :- d1(X). That yields d0(o3). But d1(o0) would produce d0(o0) again but we already have d0(o0). So maybe two rules: d0(X) :- d3(X). d0(X) :- d1(X). That gives d0(o0) from d3(o0) and d0(o3) from d1(o3). But also d1(o0) might give d0(o0) duplicate but fine.\n\nWe also need to derive d1(o0). rule: d1(X) :- d3(X). That gives d1(o0). Also d1(o3) is fact.\n\nAny other rules? Maybe d0(o0) from d2(o0) using rule d0(X) :- d2(X), not d3(X). But d2(o0) true, d3(o0) true. So not allowed.\n\nThus minimal set: two rules for d0, one rule for d1. Let's list:\n\nd0(X) :- d3(X).\nd0(X) :- d1(X).\nd1(X) :- d3(X).\n\nCheck: initial facts: d3(o0), d1(o3), d2(o1), d2(o0). From d1(X) :- d3(X), we derive d1(o0). Good. Then from d0(X) :- d3(X), we derive d0(o0). From d0(X) :- d1(X), we derive d0(o3) from d1(o3). d0(o0) also could come from second rule but already present. So stable model includes all listed: d3(o0), d1(o3), d1(o0), d0(o3), d0(o0), d2(o1), d2(o0). Good. Are there any other derivations? We don't derive d0(o1) because no rule gives that. Good. So minimal set: 3 rules.\n\nCould we reduce further? Maybe combine d0 rules: d0(X) :- d1(X). But d0(o0) also from d1(o0) after deriving it. So d0(o0) would be derived via d0(X) :- d1(X). But d1(o0) derived from d3(X) rule. So if we remove d0(X) :- d3(X), then d0(o0) would come from d1(o0) via d0(X) :- d1(X). So we could drop d0(X) :- d3(X). But then d0(o0) is still derived. So rule set: d0(X) :- d1(X). d1(X) :- d3(X). That gives d1(o0) and d0(o0) from d1(o0). d0(o3) from d1(o3). Good. But we also need d0(o3) from d1(o3) which is fact. So we still have d0(o3). So only two rules produce all. But need to consider that d1(o3) is fact; d0(X) :- d1(X) will give d0(o3). Good. So minimal set might be two rules.\n\nBut does d1(o0) rely on d3? d1(o0) derived via d1(X) :- d3(X). So we need that rule. So minimal: d1(X) :- d3(X). d0(X) :- d1(X). That's it. Check stable model: start facts: d3(o0), d1(o3), d2(o1), d2(o0). Derive d1(o0) from d1(X) :- d3(X). Then d0(o0) from d0(X) :- d1(X). Also d0(o3) from d0(X) :- d1(X) and fact d1(o3). Good. No extra derivations. So only these two rules suffice.\n\nThus minimal set: two rules.\n\nTherefore final output lines:\n\nd0(X) :- d1(X).\nd1(X) :- d3(X).\n\nMake sure formatting: each rule line. That likely the answer.",
