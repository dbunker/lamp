Additional rules produce d2(o2) and d3(o2) maybe already present. But d3(o2) is a fact, but stable model includes d3(o2). We need to produce minimal set of rules that derive d2(o2) and d3(o2) perhaps? But d3(o2) already fact. The rule maybe d3(o2) :- d2(o2). Or d2(o2) :- d0(o2). Let's think: The stable model contains d1(o1), d1(o0), d0(o2), d2(o2), d3(o2). We have facts d1(o1), d1(o0), d0(o2), d3(o2). So d2(o2) is new. The rule must produce d2(o2). Which facts used? Maybe d0(o2) leads to d2(o2). So rule: d2(X) :- d0(X). That's simple. Then d3(o2) is a fact; rule may not needed. But the problem says rules of the form predicate_0(X) :- predicate_1(X), not predicate_2(X), etc. So maybe we need to derive d3(o2) too from d2? But we already have d3(o2) as fact. Could rule produce d3(o2) from d2(o2) to create consistency? But stable model already contains d3(o2). So maybe they want to derive d3(o2) too. But it's a fact, so rule might not be necessary. However they might want to produce d3(o2) from d2(o2). Or derive d2(o2) from d0(o2) and maybe not d1. Let's examine minimal set of rules. Maybe we need two rules: d2(X) :- d0(X). d3(X) :- d2(X). But d3(o2) is a fact, but rule also ensures it. The minimal set of rules that produce d2(o2) and d3(o2) given facts. But maybe they want rule: d2(X) :- d0(X). d3(X) :- d2(X). That is minimal.\n\nCould we derive d3(o2) directly from d0(o2) with no rule for d2? But then d2(o2) wouldn't be derived. But stable model includes d2(o2). So must derive d2(o2). So rule for d2. Then d3 maybe derived from d2. That seems minimal. Another possibility: derive d3(o2) directly from d0(o2) with rule d3(X) :- d0(X). That would derive d3(o2) but not d2(o2). So we need rule for d2 as well. So minimal set: d2(X) :- d0(X). d3(X) :- d2(X). That is two rules.\n\nBut maybe we also need a rule to avoid deriving d1? But d1 facts given. Not relevant.\n\nThe question: \"Deduce minimal set of these rules where each predicate can be one of [d0, d1, d2, etc.] Write the rules as the final lines of output.\"\n\nSo we output rules in ASP syntax. Likely:\n\nd2(X) :- d0(X).\nd3(X) :- d2(X).\n\nBut need to maintain that predicates are like d2, d3. So final lines: d2(X) :- d0(X). d3(X) :- d2(X).\n\nMaybe also include \":-\" no commas. That is it.\n\nAlternatively could be \"d2(X) :- d0(X).\" and \"d3(X) :- d2(X).\".\n\nThus final output lines: d2(X) :- d0(X). d3(X) :- d2(X). Probably each on its own line.\n\nWe need minimal set: two rules. Provide them as final answer.",
