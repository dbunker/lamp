And rules of the form predicate_0(X) :- predicate_1(X), not predicate_2(X), etc. That results in the stable model: d3(o3) d3(o2) d1(o1) d1(o2) d1(o3).\n\nWe need to deduce minimal set of these rules where each predicate can be one of [d0, d1, d2, etc.] Write the rules as the final lines of output.\n\nEssentially we need to infer the rules that produce that stable model, with minimal set.\n\nFacts: d3(o3) and d3(o2) present. d1(o1) and d1(o2) present. Also stable model has d1(o3). So rule must produce d1(o3) given facts.\n\nPossibility: rule: d1(X) :- d3(X). That would derive d1(o3) from d3(o3). But d3(o2) would also produce d1(o2). But d1(o2) is already a fact. No conflict. So rule d1(X) :- d3(X). Then d1(o2) would also be derived. But it's a fact; duplicates okay. So minimal set: one rule: d1(X) :- d3(X). Also perhaps need to derive d1(o1) etc. But d1(o1) is fact; no rule needed. So minimal set is that rule.\n\nBut maybe also d0? We can choose any predicate names. The rule could be d1(X) :- d3(X). Provide that as output. But question says \"where each predicate can be one of [d0, d1, d2, etc.]\" So they are using d0, d1, d2. So maybe they want rule: d1(X) :- d3(X). That uses d1 and d3.\n\nBut we must consider minimal set: could be just that one rule. Could also include facts? No, facts are given. We only output rules.\n\nThus final lines of output: d1(X) :- d3(X). But perhaps also rule to derive d1(o3) from something else? But d1(o3) derived by rule. d1(o1) and d1(o2) are facts. So minimal set is single rule.\n\nHowever, maybe they expect two rules: d1(X) :- d3(X). And maybe d0(X) :- d1(X). But no.\n\nThus final answer: d1(X) :- d3(X).\n\nLet's output that.",
