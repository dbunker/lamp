    "thinking": "We need to deduce a minimal set of rules that produce the stable model given the facts. We have initial facts: d2(o3). d3(o0). d2(o1). d0(o1). So we have facts for d2, d3, d0. We also have a stable model that includes: d0(o1) d3(o0) d3(o1) d1(o1) d2(o3) d2(o1). So the stable model adds d3(o1) and d1(o1) beyond the facts. So we need to produce rules that entail d3(o1) and d1(o1). Also maybe derive d3(o1) from something.\n\nWe need minimal set of rules. Each predicate can be one of [d0, d1, d2, etc.] But we don't know others. We can guess simple rules like d3(X) :- d2(X). So if d2(o1) then d3(o1). But we already have d3(o0) as a fact. But d2(o1) fact leads to d3(o1). That would produce d3(o1). Also we need d1(o1). Maybe rule: d1(X) :- d0(X). Since we have d0(o1). So d1(o1). That gives d1(o1). That seems minimal: two rules.\n\nBut we need to check stable model: d2(o3), d2(o1) are facts; d0(o1) is fact; d3(o0) fact; d3(o1) from rule; d1(o1) from rule. So stable model matches. Are there any other rules needed? Maybe also rule for d3(o0) but it's already a fact. So minimal set: 2 rules.\n\nWe need to output final lines of output: each rule as \"predicate_0(X) :- predicate_1(X).\"\n\nThus: d3(X) :- d2(X). d1(X) :- d0(X). Or maybe variables naming. They want minimal set of these rules where each predicate can be one of [d0, d1, d2, etc.]. So we produce these two rules. Or maybe also rule d3(X) :- d2(X), not d0(X). But not needed.\n\nThus final answer: d3(X) :- d2(X). d1(X) :- d0(X).\n\nWrite each rule on new line.",
