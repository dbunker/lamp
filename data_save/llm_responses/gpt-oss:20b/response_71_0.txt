They say each predicate can be one of [d0, d1, d2, etc.]. So we need rules that produce d0(o2) from existing facts or other rules. We also need d0(o3) already given. d2(o2) and d3(o3) given. d4(o2) given. The stable model includes d0(o2) which is not given as fact but derived.\n\nGoal: minimal set of rules generating d0(o2). What other rules needed? Possibly rule d0(X) :- d2(X). If we have d2(o2) then d0(o2) follows. But we need to avoid deriving d0(o3) from something else? But d0(o3) is already fact. That is fine.\n\nBut must be minimal set: maybe a single rule: d0(X) :- d2(X). That would produce d0(o2). Also d0(o3) is already a fact. So model contains all given plus derived. d4(o2) fact. d3(o3) fact. So stable model includes d2(o2) d3(o3) d0(o3) d0(o2) d4(o2). That matches. Are there other rules needed? None. So minimal set: one rule: d0(X) :- d2(X). But maybe need also something like d0(X) :- d3(X). But that would derive d0(o3) from d3(o3). But d0(o3) already fact, but no harm. But minimal set could be just that rule. They want rules lines as output.\n\nThus output:\n\nd0(X) :- d2(X).\n\nBut we need syntax like d0(X) :- d2(X). They mention \"predicate_0(X) :- predicate_1(X), not predicate_2(X), etc.\" So rule syntax uses commas. For single rule: d0(X) :- d2(X). Might not need comma. Could use period at end. So final lines of output: just that rule.\n\nCheck stable model: The ASP solver might not include d0(o3) because it's a fact? They gave d0(o3) as fact. So fine.\n\nBut the rule may also derive d0(o2). So minimal set is that one rule.\n\nThus answer: output rule(s). Probably just:\n\nd0(X) :- d2(X).\n\nThat's it.",
