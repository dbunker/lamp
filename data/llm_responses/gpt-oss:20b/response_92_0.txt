Also d0(o4), d4(o1). d3(o4) is added by rules.\n\nGoal: deduce minimal set of rules that generate stable model from facts. Each rule of form predicate_0(X) :- predicate_1(X), not predicate_2(X), etc. Need to output rules.\n\nWe need rules that derive d3(o4). Perhaps rule: d3(X) :- d0(X). Because d0(o4) present so derive d3(o4). Also maybe rule: d2(X) :- d3(X). Since d3(o2) gives d2(o2)? But stable model doesn't include d2(o2). So not. We need minimal set such that only new derived atoms are d3(o4) and maybe something else? But stable model has d0(o4), d4(o1), d3(o2), d3(o4), d2(o3). That's all facts + derived d3(o4). So only new is d3(o4). So rule: d3(X) :- d0(X). That's enough. Check: given d0(o4) fact, derive d3(o4). No other derivations produce new atoms. d2(o3) fact. d3(o2) fact. d4(o1) fact. d0(o4) fact. So only d3(o4). Good.\n\nBut is rule minimal? Yes single rule. But rule must be in form predicate_0(X) :- predicate_1(X), not predicate_2(X), etc. We can have just one body atom: d3(X) :- d0(X). That's acceptable. Or if need not constraints.\n\nThus final output lines: d3(X) :- d0(X). That's final line. But maybe also need d2(X) :- d3(X). But that would produce d2(o2) and d2(o4) incorrectly. Not needed. So minimal rule set is just one rule.\n\nThus final answer: \"d3(X) :- d0(X).\"",
