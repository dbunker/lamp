We need deduce minimal set of these rules where each predicate can be one of [d0, d1, d2, etc.] Write rules as final lines of output.\n\nWe need to infer rules that produce d3(o3) given facts d0(o3), d0(o2), d2(o3), d1(o2). Likely rule: d3(X) :- d0(X), d2(X). But we need \"not\" maybe not needed. But minimal set: maybe d3(X) :- d0(X), d2(X). That would produce d3(o3) because d0(o3) and d2(o3). d3(o2) wouldn't because d2(o2) absent. Good. Also d1(o2) fact maybe not used. Could be rule d1(X) :- d0(X), not d2(X). That would produce d1(o2) because d0(o2) true, d2(o2) false. But d1(o2) already fact; but maybe derived. But minimal set of rules: need to derive all non-facts: d3(o3). We already have facts for d0, d2, d1. So only rule needed is d3(X) :- d0(X), d2(X). But question: \"minimal set of these rules where each predicate can be one of [d0, d1, d2, etc.]\". So maybe they want all rules that derive the stable model. But facts already given. So minimal set: one rule d3(X) :- d0(X), d2(X). That yields d3(o3). There might also be rule deriving d1(o2) from d0(o2) and not d2(o2). But d1(o2) is fact, not derived. So rule not needed. So minimal set is one rule.\n\nWrite the rules as final lines of output. So output line: d3(X) :- d0(X), d2(X). Maybe need to include commas. Probably \"d3(X) :- d0(X), d2(X).\" with period.\n\nThus final output: d3(X) :- d0(X), d2(X).",
