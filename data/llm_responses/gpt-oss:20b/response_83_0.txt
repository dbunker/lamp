    "thinking": "We need to understand problem. We have ASP facts: d3(o3). d3(o4). d1(o0). d0(o3). So base facts.\n\nRules of form predicate_0(X) :- predicate_1(X), not predicate_2(X), etc. We need to deduce minimal set of these rules where each predicate can be one of [d0,d1,d2,...]. Output rules lines.\n\nGiven stable model: d3(o3) d3(o4) d1(o0) d2(o3) d2(o4) d0(o3). So d2(o3) and d2(o4) are derived.\n\nWe need minimal set of rules that generate this stable model from facts.\n\nSo we have predicates d0,d1,d2,d3. d3 facts given. d1 fact given. d0 fact given. d2 derived.\n\nSo we need rule(s) that produce d2(o3) and d2(o4). Also maybe produce d0(o3) from d3? but d0(o3) already fact. But maybe derived too.\n\nWe need minimal set of rules such that stable model matches. Possibly we have rule: d2(X) :- d3(X). That would derive d2(o3) and d2(o4). But also could derive d2(o0) if d3(o0) existed but none. Also maybe rule: d0(X) :- d3(X). But d0(o3) already fact, but we might need rule to derive d0(o3) if not fact. But fact is present, we could leave as fact.\n\nBut minimal set maybe only rule: d2(X) :- d3(X). That produces d2(o3) and d2(o4). stable model includes d2's. That seems minimal.\n\nBut d0(o3) is fact, but d0(o3) could also be derived by rule from d3(o3). But since we have fact, we don't need rule.\n\nSimilarly d1(o0) fact.\n\nThus minimal set of rules: d2(X) :- d3(X). Only one rule.\n\nBut maybe we need also to ensure no other derived facts appear, like d2(o0) should not be derived. d3(o0) not present so fine.\n\nAlso we might need rule with negation? But minimal might be just one.\n\nBut question states \"rules of the form predicate_0(X) :- predicate_1(X), not predicate_2(X), etc.\" So they allow negations. But we don't need negation.\n\nThus output: d2(X) :- d3(X).\n\nBut need to output as final lines. Also maybe separate by newline: \"d2(X) :- d3(X).\" maybe with parentheses. Also note that ASP uses '.' at end. So final lines:\n\nd2(X) :- d3(X).\n\nBut maybe need to show variable X and maybe also include ':-' and '.'.\n\nHence final output:\n\nd2(X) :- d3(X).\n\nBut might need to mention that X is variable. But we can output as:\n\nd2(X) :- d3(X).\n\nShould we include only this rule? Yes.\n\nBut maybe they expect multiple rules for each derived d2. But minimal set includes only one rule.\n\nThus final answer: d2(X) :- d3(X).",
