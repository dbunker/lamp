We know base facts: d3(o0), d3(o3), d3(o1), d0(o0), d2(o0). We need rules that produce d1(o0) such that stable model matches. Minimal set: maybe one rule: d1(X) :- d0(X). Because d0(o0) is true, then d1(o0). But we must ensure no other d1 facts appear. There is only d1(o0). So rule d1(X) :- d0(X). That's minimal.\n\nAlso maybe rule for d2? d2(o0) is fact already. d3 facts are base.\n\nAlternatively we could derive d1 via d2 or d3 but not produce other. But minimal set: just rule d1(X) :- d0(X).\n\nCheck: do we need to include other rules? We could have rule d2(X) :- d0(X). But d2(o0) is already fact, we can keep as fact. We don't need rule.\n\nBut maybe they want rules for all d predicates: d3, d2, d1, d0 maybe? But given facts, maybe only rule for d1 is needed. But the phrasing: \"Deduce minimal set of these rules where each predicate can be one of [d0, d1, d2, etc.] Write the rules as the final lines of output.\" So we output lines like d1(X) :- d0(X). That is the minimal rule.\n\nHowever, maybe they also want a rule to produce d2 from d3? For example, d2(X) :- d3(X), not d1(X). But d2(o0) is true. But d1(o0) derived. Let's check: If we had rule d2(X) :- d3(X), not d1(X). For o0, d3(o0) true, but d1(o0) would be true, so not d1(o0) false, so rule doesn't produce d2(o0). But d2(o0) is fact, so ok.\n\nBut maybe we don't need any rule for d2.\n\nThus minimal set: one rule d1(X) :- d0(X).\n\nBut maybe we also need rule for d3? No, they are base facts.\n\nThus final lines of output: \"d1(X) :- d0(X).\"\n\nBut the output might be something like:\n\nd1(o0) :- d0(o0).\n\nBut rule is predicate: predicate_0(X) :- predicate_1(X). They want to write rule lines.\n\nThus final output:\n\nd1(X) :- d0(X).\n\nThus answer.",
