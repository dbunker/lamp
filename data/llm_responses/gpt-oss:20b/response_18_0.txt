    "thinking": "We need to deduce minimal set of rules that produce the given stable model from given facts. We have facts: d4(o0). d3(o2). d4(o2). d2(o1). So initial facts include d4(o0), d3(o2), d4(o2), d2(o1). The stable model includes these plus d1(o0) and d1(o2). So d1 predicates are derived by rules. Likely d1(X) :- d4(X). But check: d1(o0) and d1(o2) both derived from d4 facts: d4(o0) and d4(o2). So rule: d1(X) :- d4(X). But maybe there is a rule involving not something. But minimal set maybe just that rule. However, maybe d1(o2) also could come from d3(o2). But d1(o2) appears too. Could be rule: d1(X) :- d4(X). d1(X) :- d3(X). But d3(o2) gives d1(o2) but also d4(o2) gives d1(o2). But we need both d1(o0) and d1(o2). d1(o0) only from d4(o0). So rule d1(X) :- d4(X). So minimal set: one rule. But also maybe some rules for d0? But stable model doesn't include any d0. So no rule needed. But the question says \"Deduce minimal set of these rules where each predicate can be one of [d0, d1, d2, etc.] Write the rules as the final lines of output.\" So just output the rule(s). Possibly we need also rule for d3? But facts include d3(o2). So no rule. So just rule: d1(X) :- d4(X). We can write it as \"d1(X) :- d4(X).\" That's minimal.\n\nBut maybe need also rule for d2? Already facts: d2(o1). So no rule. So answer: d1(X) :- d4(X). That's it.\n\nThus output line: d1(X) :- d4(X).",
