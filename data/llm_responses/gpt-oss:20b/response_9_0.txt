So rule(s) that produce d0(o2). Predicates can be d0, d1, d2, etc. Minimal set of rules. So we need a rule (or rules) that derive d0(o2). We need to deduce from facts? Possibly rule: d0(X) :- d1(X). or something. Because d1(o2) present. So rule d0(X) :- d1(X). That would produce d0(o2). But maybe also could use d2 or d3 etc. But minimal set: just one rule. The rule: d0(X) :- d1(X). Alternatively could have d0(X) :- d2(X). But d2(o2) also present. That would also produce d0(o2). But which minimal? We need minimal set of these rules. Probably a single rule that uses existing predicate. The question: \"Deduce minimal set of these rules where each predicate can be one of [d0, d1, d2, etc.] Write the rules as the final lines of output.\" So we need to output final lines of output: maybe just one rule. Could be \"d0(X) :- d1(X).\" But we need to check if that is stable? Facts: d2(o2). d3(o3). d3(o2). d1(o2). Then rule: d0(X) :- d1(X). So d0(o2) derived. So stable model matches given. Good. Minimal set: one rule. So output:\n\nd0(X) :- d1(X).\n\nBut might need to include X in parentheses: d0(X) :- d1(X). Usually yes. That is final.\n\nBut might also need to ensure rule uses negation or multiple body. But minimal set would be just that rule. There's no other rules needed. So answer: d0(X) :- d1(X).",
