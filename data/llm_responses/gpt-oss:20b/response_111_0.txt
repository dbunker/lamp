Write the rules as final lines of output.\n\nEssentially we need to provide rules that produce d3(o4) given the facts, but minimal set of rules.\n\nWe need to find rules that entail d3(o4). There might be rules like d3(X) :- d4(X). But we have d4(o4) fact. Also d2(o4) and d1(o4) facts. d1(o3) fact. So maybe rule: d3(X) :- d4(X). That would give d3(o4). That might be minimal.\n\nBut maybe they want multiple rules? Minimal set of rules that yields that stable model.\n\nWe must include all facts as facts, not rules. Only rules need to be output.\n\nWe need to deduce minimal set of rules where each predicate can be one of [d0, d1, d2, etc.]. Write the rules as final lines of output.\n\nThus answer should list rule(s) like:\n\nd3(X) :- d4(X).\n\nMaybe also: d3(X) :- d2(X), not d4(X). But d4(X) already true, so not.\n\nLet's analyze: Suppose we only have rule: d3(X) :- d4(X). That uses predicate d4 as body, d3 as head. That is one rule.\n\nWe must ensure no other rules produce extra atoms. But only facts given: d4(o4), d2(o4), d1(o4), d1(o3). These facts alone produce no d3. With rule above, we get d3(o4). That matches stable model: d4(o4) d2(o4) d1(o4) d1(o3) d3(o4).\n\nSo minimal set is just that rule. Could there be a rule requiring both d4 and d2? But d3(o4) would also be derived by d4 alone, so minimal set is one rule.\n\nThus output:\n\nd3(X) :- d4(X).\n\nBut we need to output final lines of output only rules. Should we use specific variable like X or something else? Probably use X.\n\nThus final answer: one rule:\n\nd3(X) :- d4(X).\n\nLet's produce that.",
