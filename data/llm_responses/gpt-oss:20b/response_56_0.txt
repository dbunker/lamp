We need to deduce minimal set of rules where each predicate can be one of [d0,d1,d2,etc]. We need to produce rules such that from the given facts, the stable model is as given. Minimal set meaning minimal number of rules? Probably minimal in number of rules, each rule can involve at most one body literal? The form: predicate_0(X) :- predicate_1(X), not predicate_2(X), etc. So rule head is a predicate with argument X. Body may have positive or negative literals. The facts are given; rules should derive d1(o0). We need rules that produce d1(o0) given facts d0(o0) maybe. Let's think: we have fact d0(o0). We want to derive d1(o0). Could be rule: d1(X) :- d0(X). That would derive d1(o0). Also d1(o4) is a fact; d1(o2) is a fact. But we might need to prevent derivation of d1(o4) or d1(o2) if they were not facts? They are facts, so no rule needed. We need to keep d1(o4) and d1(o2) as facts. So we just need rule to get d1(o0). So minimal set: one rule d1(X) :- d0(X). That's it. But check: does that create any unintended derivations? It also would produce d1(o0) from d0(o0). Also might produce d1(o4) from d0(o4) if d0(o4) is a fact? But we only have d0(o0) as fact. So no. Also no d0(o4). So it's fine.\n\nBut what about d2(o4) fact: no rule needed. So final stable model matches facts plus derived d1(o0). So minimal set of rules: one rule: d1(X) :- d0(X). If we want minimal set maybe also include rule for d1? But maybe also we need rule for d1(X) :- d2(X) ??? But that would also produce d1(o4) from d2(o4) but d1(o4) is already fact. It would produce again but not harmful. But minimal set means simplest.\n\nThus final lines: d1(X) :- d0(X).\n\nBut they want \"predicate can be one of [d0, d1, d2, etc.]\" maybe we need to output rules like: d1(o0) :- d0(o0). But rule is with variable X. They want final lines of output: rules. So maybe:\n\nd1(X) :- d0(X).\n\nLet's produce that.",
