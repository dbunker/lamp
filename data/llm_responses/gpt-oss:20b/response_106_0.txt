So extra atom: d3(o2) appears, not in facts. So rule must derive d3(o2). Also maybe other rules? The model includes all facts plus derived d3(o2). So minimal set of rules that produce exactly that stable model. We can have rules that derive d3(o2) from some condition. Since we have d4(o2) fact, maybe rule: d3(X) :- d4(X). That would derive d3(o2). Could also produce d3(o1) if d4(o1) existed, but no. Minimal set: one rule: d3(X) :- d4(X). But also might need rules to prevent other derivations? But we only have these facts; no other rules. So stable model will be closure of facts plus rules: d3(o2) only. That matches stable model. So answer: d3(X) :- d4(X). Also maybe include explicit variable: d3(o2) :- d4(o2). But rule form: d3(X) :- d4(X). That should be fine. Output final lines: d3(X) :- d4(X). Also maybe no other rule. So minimal set is one rule. So output that line.",
