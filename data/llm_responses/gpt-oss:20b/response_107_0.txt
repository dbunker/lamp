Then we have rules of the form predicate_0(X) :- predicate_1(X), not predicate_2(X), etc. We need minimal set of such rules that lead to stable model containing: d3(o0) d2(o4) d1(o0) d0(o1) d0(o2). Wait d3(o0) and d2(o4) already facts. d0(o1), d0(o2) are facts. Additional derived: d1(o0). So we need rule(s) that derive d1(o0) from other predicates (maybe d3(o0)? or d2(o4)? etc). Minimal set of rules: likely one rule: d1(X) :- d3(X). Or maybe d1(X) :- d3(X), not d2(X). But d2(o4) but not d2(o0). So not needed. The rule d1(o0) :- d3(o0). Since we have d3(o0) as fact. So minimal: d1(X) :- d3(X). That's it. But they said rules of the form predicate_0(X) :- predicate_1(X), not predicate_2(X), etc. So could include negations. But minimal set: only rule. But maybe also rule to produce d0? Already facts. So minimal is one rule. But might require other rule to generate d0? no.\n\nThus final output: d1(X) :- d3(X).\n\nHowever maybe they require \"d1(o0).\" as fact? No. They want rules. So output:\n\nd1(X) :- d3(X).\n\nBut could we reduce further? No.\n\nThus final.",
