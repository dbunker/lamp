    "thinking": "We need to deduce minimal set of rules that produce the stable model given the facts. The facts: d3(o1), d3(o2), d0(o0), d2(o1). The stable model includes those facts plus derived ones: d1(o1), d1(o2), d2(o0). So rules must infer d1 and d2. We need minimal set of rules (maybe 3 rules). We can propose:\n\nd1(X) :- d3(X).\nd1(X) :- d0(X).\nd2(X) :- d1(X), not d3(X).\nd2(X) :- d0(X).\n\nBut we need to produce all derived facts: d1(o1) derived from d3(o1) or d0? d1(o2) from d3(o2). d2(o0) from d0(o0). Also d2(o1) given as fact. But d2(o1) is also fact. The rules must allow that.\n\nWe also need that d2(o0) derived. d2(o0) derived from d0(o0) maybe via d2(X) :- d0(X). That gives d2(o0). Also d2(o1) is fact. But we need also d2(o1) to be in stable model. It's given as fact.\n\nHowever, we need to ensure no extra derivations produce extra atoms beyond those in stable model. For instance, if we had rule d1(X) :- d0(X) then would derive d1(o0). But d1(o0) is not in stable model. So can't have that rule.\n\nThus minimal set: maybe\n\nd1(X) :- d3(X).\nd2(X) :- d0(X).\n\nAnd that's all? Check: d1(o1) derived from d3(o1). d1(o2) from d3(o2). d2(o0) from d0(o0). Also d2(o1) is fact. So stable model has those. We need ensure no rule causes d1(o0) or d1(o3) etc. No other derivations. That set seems minimal.\n\nBut might need default negation? Not necessary. We need minimal set of these rules where each predicate can be one of [d0, d1, d2, etc.]. So output final lines of rules.\n\nThus output:\n\nd1(X) :- d3(X).\nd2(X) :- d0(X).\n\nWe might also need to include rule for d2(o1) but it's fact already. So no rule needed.\n\nThus final answer lines.",
