    "thinking": "We need to deduce minimal set of rules that produce the given stable model. We have facts: d2(o0). d1(o0). d2(o1). d3(o1). And we want rules that generate d0(o0) and maybe others? The stable model: d2(o0) d2(o1) d1(o0) d0(o0) d3(o1). So we need rules such that d0(o0) is derived, and no other atoms derived. We can use default negation. Minimal set of rules: maybe d0(X) :- d2(X), not d1(X). For o0: d2(o0) true, d1(o0) true so not d1(X) fails. But we need d0(o0) true. So maybe d0(X) :- d2(X), not d3(X). For o0, d3(o0) not present, so d0(o0) true. For o1, d2(o1) true, d3(o1) true, so not d3 fails -> d0(o1) not derived. That works. Also no other rules produce extra atoms. So minimal rules: one rule: d0(X) :- d2(X), not d3(X). Also maybe a rule to derive d0 for others? Just that. Are there any constraints to prevent d0(o1)? That is fine. Also ensure d0(o0) derived. Yes. Minimal set is one rule.\n\nBut check: Could d0 be derived via d1? But d1(o0) true, so if rule uses not d1, fails. So rule uses not d3. Good.\n\nThus output final lines: d0(X) :- d2(X), not d3(X).\n\nWe might need variable names: d0(X) :- d2(X), not d3(X). That's it.\n\nBut problem statement: \"Deduce minimal set of these rules where each predicate can be one of [d0, d1, d2, etc.] Write the rules as the final lines of output.\" So we output rule(s) only. So final output: one line: d0(X) :- d2(X), not d3(X). Probably with period. So: d0(X) :- d2(X), not d3(X). That's it.",
