So we need rules that derive d0(o3). Also possibly other derived? The final stable model lists all facts plus derived. So we need rules that produce d0(o3) given other facts. And minimal set of rules, each predicate can be one of [d0,d1,d2,etc]. We want rules that produce d0(o3) using possibly other predicates like d0(X), d1(X), d2(X), d3(X). The facts are d2(o4), d3(o4), d3(o3), d1(o3), d0(o4). So we need a rule: d0(X) :- d1(X), d2(X). Maybe? Let's try: To derive d0(o3), we need d1(o3) (fact) and maybe d2(o3) but we don't have d2(o3). So maybe rule d0(X) :- d1(X). But that would produce d0(o3). But also d0(o4) already fact. But we might also derive d0(o4) again. That rule would produce d0 for any X where d1(X). Since we have only d1(o3). So okay.\n\nBut we also want minimal set of rules: maybe only one rule: d0(X) :- d1(X). That yields d0(o3). That is minimal: one rule.\n\nBut the question says \"Deduce minimal set of these rules where each predicate can be one of [d0, d1, d2, etc.] Write the rules as the final lines of output.\" Perhaps they expect multiple rules to derive d0(o4) also? But d0(o4) already fact, so no rule needed. They want minimal set of rules to produce the stable model given the facts. So we just need to produce d0(o3). So rule: d0(X) :- d1(X). That's enough. But maybe we also need a rule to produce d2(o4) or d3(o4) etc. But they are facts already. So no rules. The minimal set is just that rule. Could also produce d0(o4) via rule but already fact.\n\nThus output line: d0(X) :- d1(X). But they might expect the variable naming: d0(X) :- d1(X). Use same format as given: predicate_0(X) :- predicate_1(X). So d0(X) :- d1(X). Provide final line.\n\nLet's output that.",
