So extra derived d1(o2). So rule needed to derive d1(o2). The minimal set of rules: maybe rule: d1(X) :- d0(X). Since d0(o2) fact, then d1(o2). Also maybe rule d1(X) :- d2(X). Since d2(o2) fact, derive d1(o2). Both would produce d1(o2). Which is minimal? If we include one rule, we need to derive d1(o2). But we also have d1(o0) fact. So rule d1(X) :- d0(X). gives d1(o2). Works. Another rule d1(X) :- d2(X) also works. Which minimal set? The question: \"Deduce minimal set of these rules where each predicate can be one of [d0, d1, d2, etc.] Write the rules as the final lines of output.\" Probably need to output rule(s). Minimal set means minimal number of rules to produce the stable model. We need at least one rule to derive d1(o2). Could also use rule d1(X) :- d0(X), d2(X). But that's more complex. Minimal is single rule.\n\nSo output: d1(X) :- d0(X). Or d1(X) :- d2(X). Which one is more natural? If we think that d1 derives from d0 and d2? The stable model includes d1(o2) derived from d0(o2) and d2(o2). But we don't have rule that uses both. The minimal is just one rule: d1(X) :- d0(X). That will produce d1(o2). It also would produce d1(o0)? Wait d0(o0) is not a fact. So only d1(o2). That's fine.\n\nThus output lines: d1(X) :- d0(X). Probably.\n\nAlso we might need rule for d1(o0) but that's fact already. So no rule needed.\n\nThus final output:\n\nd1(X) :- d0(X).\n\nBut the format: maybe one line per rule. So:\n\nd1(X) :- d0(X).\n\nThat's all.\n\nLet's produce that.",
