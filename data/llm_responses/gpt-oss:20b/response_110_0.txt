We have facts and rules. The stable model includes d3(o2), d0(o0), d2(o3), d2(o2), d4(o1). We need minimal set of rules that, given the facts, produce that model. We have to use predicates d0, d1, d2, d3, d4 maybe? The facts already have d2(o3), d3(o2), d0(o0), d4(o1). The stable model also has d2(o2). So we need a rule to derive d2(o2). We also have d3(o2) already fact. d0(o0) fact. d4(o1) fact. d2(o3) fact. So the only new derived atom is d2(o2). So need a rule deriving d2(o2) from something. Perhaps d2(o2) :- d3(o2). That would explain. But they mention \"predicate_0(X) :- predicate_1(X), not predicate_2(X), etc.\" The minimal set of rules: maybe just one rule: d2(X) :- d3(X). That would produce d2(o2). But would also produce d2(o3) because d3(o2) only for o2, but d3(o2) is the only d3 fact, so only d2(o2). So yes.\n\nHowever stable model also includes d3(o2) which is a fact. d0(o0) fact. d4(o1) fact. So minimal set of rules is a single rule.\n\nBut maybe they want to include \"not\" to enforce minimality? But minimal set might require negative literals to avoid other derivations like d2(o0)? No, only one rule needed.\n\nCould also use d2(X) :- d0(X). That would derive d2(o0), but that not in stable model, so not good. Similarly d2(X) :- d4(X) would produce d2(o1). Not present. So rule must refer to d3. So rule: d2(X) :- d3(X). That yields d2(o2). So minimal set is just that.\n\nBut the question says \"deduce minimal set of these rules where each predicate can be one of [d0, d1, d2, etc.]\". Maybe they want multiple rules, one for each derived atom? But only d2(o2) derived. So we output:\n\nd2(X) :- d3(X).\n\nBut they might want each rule on a line with dot. So output:\n\nd2(X) :- d3(X).\n\nLet's produce final answer.",
