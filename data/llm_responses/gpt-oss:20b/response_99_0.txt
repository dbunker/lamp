We need to deduce minimal set of rules that produce this stable model, given those facts.\n\nAssumptions: The program uses rules of form: predicate_0(X) :- predicate_1(X), not predicate_2(X), etc. We need to find minimal set of rules such that stable model equals given facts + derived d1(o3). So we need rules that cause d1(o3) to be true, but no other derived atoms.\n\nWe can have rule: d1(X) :- d0(X). But we already have d0(o3). That would give d1(o3). Also need not to produce d1(o1) etc. We don't have d0(o1). So rule d1(X) :- d0(X) suffices.\n\nAlso maybe need rule: d1(X) :- d4(X). But d4(o3) is present, would also produce d1(o3). But we already produce. We want minimal rules: maybe one rule enough: d1(X) :- d0(X). That produces d1(o3). No other d1's because no other d0's. So stable model includes d1(o3). So minimal set of rules: single rule. But the problem statement says \"minimal set of these rules where each predicate can be one of [d0, d1, d2, etc.]\". So output should list rule(s) lines.\n\nBut maybe need also rule for d2? No derived d2 beyond given facts. So no rule needed.\n\nThus output: d1(X) :- d0(X). But maybe need variable name X; in ASP typical variable names uppercase. The rule: d1(X) :- d0(X). Also maybe use not? Not needed.\n\nThus final output lines: d1(X) :- d0(X). But the instruction: Write the rules as the final lines of output. So maybe output exactly that.\n\nCheck: given facts: d0(o3). So d1(o3). Yes. Stable model matches.\n\nThus minimal set: one rule. So output that line. Also possibly d1(X) :- d4(X). But choose one.\n\nThus final answer: d1(X) :- d0(X).",
