From d0(o0) in facts \u2192 d0(o0) in model \u2713\n2. From d3(o3) in facts \u2192 d3(o3) in model \u2713  \n3. From d3(o1) in facts \u2192 d3(o1) in model \u2713\n4. From d4(o1) in facts \u2192 d4(o1) in model \u2713\n5. d2(o1) appears in model but not in facts \u2192 must be derived by rules\n\nFor d2(o1) to be derived, there must be a rule like:\n- d2(o1) :- some_condition\n\nSince d4(o1) is in both facts and model, and d2(o1) appears in model, a possible rule could be:\n- d2(X) :- d4(X)\n\nBut let me check if there are other dependencies. Looking at the stable model, I can see that:\n- d0(o0) is already in facts, so no rule needed\n- d3(o3) and d3(o1) are in facts, so no rules needed  \n- d4(o1) is in facts, so no rule needed\n- d2(o1) must be derived\n\nThe minimal set of rules would be:\n- d2(X) :- d4(X)\n\nThis rule would derive d2(o1) from the fact d4(o1), which matches the stable model.\n\nd2(X) :- d4(X).",
