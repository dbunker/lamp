The most straightforward rule would be:\n\n```\nd3(X) :- d0(X).\n```\n\nThis would derive d3(o4) from d0(o4).\n\nLooking at the pattern, I also need to check if there are other rules that might be needed to generate the other predicates. Since d1(o2) and d2(o1) are already facts, they don't need rules to generate them.\n\nThe minimal set of rules needed is:\n\n```\nd3(X) :- d0(X).\n```",
