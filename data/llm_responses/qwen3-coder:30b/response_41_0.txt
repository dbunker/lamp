These could be:\n- Rules that allow them to be true\n- Or they could be derived from other rules\n\nLooking more carefully at the stable model, it seems like d1(o0) is being derived from d0(o0). The minimal rules that would generate this are:\n\nd1(X) :- d0(X).\nd2(X) :- d2(X).  [This is a tautology - it's just saying d2(X) is true if d2(X) is true]\nd3(X) :- d3(X).  [Same for d3]\n\nBut that doesn't make sense for the stable model. Let me reconsider.\n\nActually, looking at this more systematically:\n- The stable model contains d0(o0), d1(o0), d2(o3), d3(o1), d3(o4)\n- The original facts are d3(o4), d2(o3), d3(o1), d0(o0)\n- d1(o0) is the only new fact in the stable model\n\nThe simplest rule that would generate d1(o0) from d0(o0) is:\nd1(X) :- d0(X).\n\nThe other facts d2(o3), d3(o1), d3(o4) are already facts, so they don't require rules to be true.\n\nd1(X) :- d0(X).",
