    "content": "Looking at the given facts and stable model, I need to deduce the minimal set of rules that would generate this result.\n\nGiven facts:\n- d3(o3), d1(o3), d1(o0), d3(o2), d2(o2)\n\nStable model result:\n- d3(o3), d3(o2), d2(o2), d0(o2), d1(o3), d1(o0)\n\nLet me analyze what rules are needed:\n\n1. From facts d1(o3), d1(o0) - these are already in the stable model\n2. From facts d3(o3), d3(o2) - these are already in the stable model  \n3. From fact d2(o2) - this is in the stable model\n4. d0(o2) appears in the stable model but not in the facts - this must be derived\n\nSince d0(o2) must be derived, and it's the only new predicate in the stable model, I need a rule that derives d0(o2) from the existing facts.\n\nLooking at the pattern, if there's a rule like:\nd0(X) :- d2(X), not d1(X), not d3(X)\n\nThis would derive d0(o2) since d2(o2) is true, and d1(o2) and d3(o2) are false in the stable model.\n\nBut I need to be more careful - let me check what other predicates might be involved.\n\nActually, looking more systematically:\n- d0(o2) is derived from d2(o2) and the absence of d1(o2) and d3(o2)\n- This suggests a rule like: d0(X) :- d2(X), not d1(X), not d3(X)\n\nBut I also need to consider if there are rules for d3, d2, d1 predicates themselves.\n\nThe minimal rules that would generate this stable model are:\n\nd0(X) :- d2(X), not d1(X), not d3(X).\nd1(X) :- d1(X). [identity rule or fact]\nd2(X) :- d2(X). [identity rule or fact]  \nd3(X) :- d3(X). [identity rule or fact]\n\nHowever, since we're asked for minimal set and the stable model shows that d0(o2) is derived from d2(o2), and the other predicates are already in the facts, the essential rule is:\n\nd0(X) :- d2(X), not d1(X), not d3(X).",
