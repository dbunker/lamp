The other facts appear in both the initial facts and final model.\n\nLet me analyze what rules would be needed:\n\n1. Since d0(o2) appears in the model but not in the facts, there must be a rule like:\n   d0(X) :- some_condition(X)\n\n2. Looking at the pattern, it seems like d0(o2) might be derived from d2(o2) or some other condition.\n\n3. Since d2(o2) is given as a fact and appears in the model, and d0(o2) also appears in the model, there might be a rule like:\n   d0(X) :- d2(X)\n\n4. Similarly, d0(o0) appears in both facts and model, so it's likely a direct fact or derived from itself.\n\nThe minimal rules that would generate this stable model are:\n\nd0(X) :- d2(X).\nd0(X) :- d0(X).\n\nWait, let me reconsider. The stable model shows d0(o2) is derived, so there must be a rule that derives it from d2(o2). Since d2(o2) is given as a fact, and d0(o2) appears in the model, the simplest rule would be:\n\nd0(X) :- d2(X).\n\nBut I also need to account for d0(o0) being in the model. If it's not derived from any rule, it must be a fact or there's a rule that generates it from d0(o0) itself (which would be a tautology).\n\nActually, looking more carefully, if d0(o0) appears in both the facts and the stable model, and d0(o2) appears only in the stable model, then d0(o2) must be derived from d2(o2).\n\nThe minimal rules are:\n\nd0(X) :- d2(X).",
