Since we're looking for minimal rules, and d0(o0) is the only new atom, I need a rule that derives d0(o0).\n\nLooking at the pattern, the most straightforward rule would be:\n```\nd0(X) :- d1(X).\n```\n\nThis would derive d0(o0) from d1(o0), which is present in both facts and stable model.\n\nHowever, let me reconsider what rules are needed to generate exactly the stable model:\n\nThe stable model contains: d1(o0), d0(o4), d0(o0), d2(o4), d3(o1)\n\n- d2(o4) is given as a fact\n- d1(o0) is given as a fact  \n- d3(o1) is given as a fact\n- d0(o4) is given as a fact\n- d0(o0) must be derived\n\nThe minimal rule needed is:\n```\nd0(X) :- d1(X).\n```\n\nThis rule, together with the given facts, generates the complete stable model.\n\n```\nd0(X) :- d1(X).\n```",
