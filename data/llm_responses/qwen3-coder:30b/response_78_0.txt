The rules should be minimal and generate the exact model.\n\nLooking more carefully:\n- d0(o0) must be derived from d3(o0) \n- d2(o0) must be derived from d3(o0)\n- d2(o2) must be derived from d0(o2) or some other rule\n\nActually, let me think about what rules would generate all the required facts:\n\n```\nd0(X) :- d3(X).\nd2(X) :- d3(X).\nd2(X) :- d0(X).\n```",
