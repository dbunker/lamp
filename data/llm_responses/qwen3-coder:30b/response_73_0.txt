Looking at the pattern and the fact that d3(o3) is present, a likely rule would be:\n\nd1(X) :- d3(X).\n\nLet me verify this makes sense with the other facts:\n- d3(o3) is given, so d1(o3) would be derived\n- No other facts would trigger d1, so this seems minimal\n\nThe minimal set of rules is:\n\nd1(X) :- d3(X).",
