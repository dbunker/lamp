Since we have d2 and d0 facts, and we want to generate d3, the simplest rules would be:\n\n```\nd3(X) :- d2(X).\nd3(X) :- d0(X).\n```\n\nHowever, let me reconsider - looking at the stable model more carefully, the rules must be such that:\n- d3(o0) is generated (from d2(o0) or d0(o0) - but d0(o0) isn't given)\n- d3(o2) is generated (from d2(o2) or d0(o2) - d0(o2) is given)\n\nSo the minimal rules would be:\n```\nd3(X) :- d2(X).\nd3(X) :- d0(X).\n```",
