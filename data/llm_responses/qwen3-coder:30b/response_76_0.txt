The facts d4(o2), d4(o1), d3(o2), d1(o1) are given\n2. d2(o1) must be generated by a rule\n3. d2(o1) is the only new fact that appears in the stable model\n\nLooking at the pattern and the fact that d2(o1) appears in the stable model, I need a rule that can generate d2(o1) from existing facts.\n\nThe minimal rule would be:\nd2(X) :- d1(X).\n\nThis rule, combined with the fact d1(o1), would generate d2(o1).\n\nLet me verify this works with the given facts:\n- d1(o1) is given\n- From rule d2(X) :- d1(X), we get d2(o1)\n- The facts d4(o2), d4(o1), d3(o2) are already given\n\nThis explains all the facts in the stable model.\n\nd2(X) :- d1(X).",
