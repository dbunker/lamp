Looking at the pattern, it seems like d1(X) might be generated when d2(X) is true.\n\nFor d2(o1), d2(o4): These are given facts.\n\nFor d3(o1), d3(o4): These must be generated by rules. \n\nFor d4(o2): This is given as a fact.\n\nLooking at the relationships, I can see that:\n- d1(X) seems to be generated from d2(X) \n- d3(X) seems to be generated from d2(X) as well\n- d4(X) is given directly\n\nLet me construct the minimal rules:\n\nd1(X) :- d2(X).\nd3(X) :- d2(X).\nd4(X) :- d4(X). [This is redundant since d4(o2) is already given]\n\nActually, let me reconsider the structure more carefully. Since d4(o2) is given as a fact, and d1 and d3 are generated, I need to think about what generates d1 and d3.\n\nLooking at the stable model, if d1(o1) and d1(o4) are generated, and d2(o1) and d2(o4) are facts, then:\nd1(X) :- d2(X).\n\nSimilarly for d3:\nd3(X) :- d2(X).\n\nBut we also have d1(o2) and d4(o2) where d2(o2) is not given. This suggests there might be other rules.\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the stable model, it seems like:\n- d1(X) is generated when d2(X) is true\n- d3(X) is generated when d2(X) is true\n- d4(o2) is a fact\n- d0(o0) is a fact\n\nThe minimal rules are:\n\nd1(X) :- d2(X).\nd3(X) :- d2(X).",
