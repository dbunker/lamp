For d0(o1): This is already in the facts, so no rule needed\n2. For d1(o1): This is already in the facts, so no rule needed  \n3. For d1(o3): This is already in the facts, so no rule needed\n4. For d2(o4): This is already in the facts, so no rule needed\n5. For d3(o1): This is NOT in the original facts, so it must be derived\n6. For d3(o3): This is already in the facts, so no rule needed\n\nSince d3(o1) appears in the stable model but not in the original facts, it must be derived by some rule. The most natural rule would be:\n\nd3(X) :- d1(X).\n\nThis would derive d3(o1) from d1(o1), which matches what we see in the stable model.\n\nLooking more carefully at the stable model, I need to ensure that all the derived facts are properly explained by rules. The key insight is that d3(o1) must be derived from d1(o1), and there are no other derivations needed.\n\nThe minimal set of rules is:\n\nd3(X) :- d1(X).",
