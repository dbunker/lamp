The most straightforward rule would be:\n```\nd0(X) :- d2(X).\n```\n\nThis rule would derive d0(o3) from the fact d2(o3).\n\nLet me verify this is minimal - we need:\n- d1(o1), d1(o0), d1(o2) are already given as facts\n- d2(o3) is given as a fact  \n- d0(o3) needs to be derived from d2(o3)\n\nThe minimal rule set is:\n```\nd0(X) :- d2(X).\n```",
