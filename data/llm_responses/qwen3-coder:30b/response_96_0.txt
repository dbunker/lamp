    "content": "Looking at the given facts and stable model, I need to deduce the minimal set of rules that would generate this result.\n\nGiven facts:\n- d3(o0)\n- d4(o1) \n- d1(o3)\n- d0(o1)\n- d2(o3)\n\nStable model output:\n- d4(o1)\n- d1(o3)\n- d1(o1)\n- d3(o0)\n- d2(o3)\n- d2(o0)\n- d0(o1)\n\nLet me analyze what rules would be needed:\n\n1. From d3(o0) in facts \u2192 d3(o0) in model \u2713\n2. From d4(o1) in facts \u2192 d4(o1) in model \u2713  \n3. From d1(o3) in facts \u2192 d1(o3) in model \u2713\n4. From d0(o1) in facts \u2192 d0(o1) in model \u2713\n5. From d2(o3) in facts \u2192 d2(o3) in model \u2713\n\nThe additional facts in the model that weren't in the original facts:\n- d1(o1) \n- d2(o0)\n\nFor d1(o1) to be derived, there must be a rule like: d1(X) :- some_condition\nFor d2(o0) to be derived, there must be a rule like: d2(X) :- some_condition\n\nSince we want minimal rules, and the stable model contains all the facts plus these derived ones, the minimal rules would be:\n\nd1(o1) :- d0(o1).\nd2(o0) :- d3(o0).\n\nHowever, looking more carefully at the stable model, I need to determine what rules would actually generate these specific facts. The most logical minimal rules would be:\n\nd1(X) :- d0(X), not d2(X).\nd2(X) :- d3(X), not d1(X).\n\nBut since we want to minimize the rules and we're given that each predicate can be one of [d0, d1, d2, etc.], the actual minimal set of rules that would generate this stable model is:\n\nd1(o1) :- d0(o1).\nd2(o0) :- d3(o0).",
