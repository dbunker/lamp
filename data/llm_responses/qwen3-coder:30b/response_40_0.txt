Looking at the pattern, it's likely that d1(o4) is derived from d0(o4) and/or d3(o4) with some negation.\n\nThe minimal rules needed are:\n\nd1(X) :- d0(X), not d2(X).\nd1(X) :- d3(X), not d2(X).\n\nBut since d2(o0) exists, and we want to derive d1(o4), we need to be more careful. Looking at the stable model, d1(o4) is derived because d0(o4) is true and d2(o4) is false (since d2(o0) exists but not d2(o4)).\n\nThe minimal rules are:\nd1(X) :- d0(X), not d2(X).\nd1(X) :- d3(X), not d2(X).\n\nActually, looking more carefully, since d1(o4) appears in the final model, and we have d0(o4) and d3(o4) in the facts, we need rules that can derive d1(o4) from these.\n\nd1(X) :- d0(X).\nd1(X) :- d3(X).\n\nBut we need to check if d2(o4) is false to make this work properly. Since d2(o0) is the only d2 fact, d2(o4) is indeed false.\n\nThe minimal set of rules is:\nd1(X) :- d0(X), not d2(X).\nd1(X) :- d3(X), not d2(X).",
