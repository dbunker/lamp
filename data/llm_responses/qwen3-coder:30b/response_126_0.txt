Looking at the stable model, I can see that:\n- d0(o2) is in the model but not in the facts\n- d2(o2) is in the model but not in the facts\n- d3(o0) and d3(o1) are in both facts and model\n- d4(o0) and d1(o0) are in both facts and model\n\nThe minimal rules that could generate this are:\n\n```\nd0(X) :- d3(X).\nd1(X) :- d4(X).\nd2(X) :- d0(X), not d3(X).\nd3(X) :- d1(X).\n```\n\nActually, let me think even more systematically. The simplest approach is to consider that each predicate should be defined by some rule, and the stable model shows what's true.\n\n```\nd0(X) :- d1(X), not d2(X).\nd1(X) :- d4(X).\nd2(X) :- d3(X), not d0(X).\nd3(X) :- d0(X).\n```",
