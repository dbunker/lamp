For d2(o0) and d2(o2) to be in the model, and they're already given as facts, so no rule needed for them directly.\n\n2. For d0(o4) to be in the model, it's given as a fact.\n\n3. For d1(o0) and d1(o2) to be in the model, they must be derived from rules.\n\n4. For d3(o4) to be in the model, it's given as a fact.\n\nLooking at the pattern, I can see that:\n- d1(o0) and d1(o2) are derived from d2(o0) and d2(o2) respectively\n- This suggests rules of the form: d1(X) :- d2(X)\n\nLet me check if this works:\n- If d2(o0) is true, then d1(o0) can be derived\n- If d2(o2) is true, then d1(o2) can be derived\n\nThis would be the minimal set of rules needed:\n\nd1(X) :- d2(X).",
