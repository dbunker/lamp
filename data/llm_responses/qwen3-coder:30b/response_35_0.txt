All other atoms are either in facts or were already present\n\nLooking at the pattern, I can see that:\n- d2(o0) likely comes from some rule involving d1(o0) or other predicates\n- d3(o2) likely comes from some rule involving d0(o2) or other predicates\n\nThe minimal rules that would generate this stable model are:\n\n```\nd2(X) :- d1(X).\nd3(X) :- d0(X).\nd2(0) :- d1(0).\nd3(2) :- d0(2).\n```\n\nWait, let me reconsider this more carefully. Looking at the stable model, I see that:\n- d2(o0) is derived (not in original facts)\n- d3(o2) is derived (not in original facts)\n\nThe minimal rules that would generate this are:\n\n```\nd2(X) :- d1(X).\nd3(X) :- d0(X).\n```\n\nThese two rules, combined with the given facts, would produce the stable model where:\n- d1(o0) exists, so d2(o0) is derived\n- d0(o2) exists, so d3(o2) is derived\n- All other atoms are either in the facts or derived from them",
