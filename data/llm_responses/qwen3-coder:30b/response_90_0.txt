From the facts, I can see that d0(o1), d3(o0), d3(o2), d4(o3), d2(o2) are all present\n2. The stable model also includes d3(o1), which wasn't in the original facts\n3. This suggests there's a rule that generates d3(o1) from some other conditions\n\nLooking at the pattern, I need rules that can:\n- Generate d3(o1) from existing facts or conditions\n- Maintain all the other facts\n- Be minimal\n\nThe most likely rules are:\n\n```\nd3(X) :- d0(X).\nd3(X) :- d2(X).\nd3(X) :- d4(X).\nd0(X) :- d0(X).\nd2(X) :- d2(X).\nd4(X) :- d4(X).\n```\n\nBut since we want the minimal set and we see d3(o1) is generated, there must be a rule that derives it. The simplest approach is to look for rules that could generate d3(o1) from the existing facts.\n\nActually, looking more carefully, if we have d0(o1) in the facts and d3(o1) in the model, then we need a rule like:\n`d3(X) :- d0(X).`\n\nThe minimal set of rules that would generate this stable model is:\n\n```\nd3(X) :- d0(X).\nd3(X) :- d2(X).\nd3(X) :- d4(X).\n```",
