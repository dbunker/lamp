The facts d1(o0), d0(o4), d1(o3), d0(o0) are given, so they don't need rules\n2. The stable model includes d3(o4) and d3(o0), which must be derived from rules\n3. Since d3(o4) and d3(o0) appear in the final model, there must be rules that generate these\n\nLooking at the pattern, it seems like:\n- d3(X) can be derived from d0(X) or d1(X) with some conditions\n- Since d0(o4) and d0(o0) are facts, and d3(o4) and d3(o0) appear in the model, there's likely a rule like: d3(X) :- d0(X)\n- Similarly for d1, since d1(o0) and d1(o3) are facts, and d3(o0) and d3(o4) are derived\n\nThe minimal rules needed are:\n```\nd3(X) :- d0(X).\nd3(X) :- d1(X).\n```",
