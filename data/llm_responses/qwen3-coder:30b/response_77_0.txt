Looking at the facts and model, I need rules that can derive the additional facts.\n\nThe minimal rules that would work are:\nd0(X) :- d1(X), not d2(X).\nd3(X) :- d2(X), not d0(X).  \nd3(X) :- d1(X), not d0(X).\n\nBut looking more systematically, the key insight is that we have:\n- Facts: d3(o0), d2(o3), d1(o2), d0(o1)  \n- Model: d1(o2) d2(o3) d0(o1) d0(o2) d3(o0) d3(o1) d3(o2)\n\nThe simplest approach is to have rules that can generate the missing facts:\nd0(X) :- d1(X).\nd3(X) :- d2(X).  \nd3(X) :- d1(X).\n\nBut this would be too broad. Looking more carefully at the stable model, I think the minimal set is:\n\nd0(X) :- d1(X).\nd3(X) :- d2(X).\nd3(X) :- d1(X).",
