Looking at the stable model, I need to determine what rules would generate the final result from the given facts.\n\nThe most likely minimal rules are:\n```\nd3(X) :- d4(X).\n```\n\nThis rule would generate d3(o2) from the fact d4(o2), which matches what we see in the stable model.\n\nSince d0(o3), d1(o1), and d2(o3) are already in the facts and appear in the stable model, no additional rules are needed for them.\n\nThe minimal set of rules is:\n```\nd3(X) :- d4(X).\n```",
