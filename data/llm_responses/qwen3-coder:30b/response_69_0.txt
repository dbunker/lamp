The most natural rule would be:\n\nd1(X) :- d2(X).\n\nThis rule would derive d1(o0) from d2(o0), which matches what we see in the stable model.\n\nLet me verify this is minimal - we need:\n1. The facts as given\n2. A rule to derive d1(o0) from d2(o0)\n\nThe minimal set of rules is:\n\nd1(X) :- d2(X).",
