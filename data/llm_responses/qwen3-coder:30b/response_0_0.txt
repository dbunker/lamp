The stable model contains d1(o3) which wasn't in the original facts, so there must be a rule that derives it.\n\nThe minimal rules needed are:\n\nd1(X) :- d3(X).\nd1(X) :- d2(X).\nd2(X) :- d1(X).\n\nWait, let me reconsider this more systematically. \n\nLooking at what we need to generate:\n- d1(o3) must be derived\n- The other facts are already given\n\nIf we have d3(o3) and a rule d1(X) :- d3(X), then d1(o3) would be derived.\n\nBut we also have d1(o1) and d1(o2) in the original facts. \n\nThe minimal set of rules that could produce this result:\n\nd1(X) :- d3(X).\n\nThis single rule with the given facts would produce the stable model shown, since d3(o3) exists and would derive d1(o3).",
