The most likely rule would be:\n- d1(X) :- d2(X) \n\nBut since d2(o2) is not in the facts, this wouldn't work.\n\nActually, let me reconsider - there might be rules that use the facts to generate new facts. \n\nThe minimal rules needed:\n- d1(o2) :- d3(o2) [if d3(o2) generates d1(o2)]\n- Or some other relationship\n\nLooking at the structure, the most straightforward minimal rules are:\n\nd1(o2) :- d2(o1).\nd1(o0) :- d2(o0).\nd1(o2) :- d3(o2).\n\nWait, let me reconsider the problem statement. The rules are of the form:\npredicate_0(X) :- predicate_1(X), not predicate_2(X), etc.\n\nSo I need to write rules that, when applied to the facts, produce the stable model.\n\nThe minimal set of rules is:\nd1(o2) :- d2(o1).\nd1(o0) :- d2(o0).",
