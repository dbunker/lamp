A rule to generate d4(o0) and d4(o2) from some condition\n2. A rule to generate d1(o1) from some condition\n\nLooking at the pattern, the most likely minimal rules are:\n\nd4(X) :- d4(Y), d0(Y), d1(Y), d2(Y), d3(Y), d4(Z), d1(Z), d0(Z), d2(Z), d3(Z).\n\nWait, let me reconsider this more systematically.\n\nLooking at what needs to be generated:\n- d4(o0) and d4(o2) are new\n- d1(o1) is new\n\nThe minimal rules that would generate these are likely:\n1. d4(X) :- d0(X), d1(X), d2(X), d3(X) \n2. d1(X) :- d0(X), d2(X), d3(X), d4(X)\n\nActually, let me think more carefully about the stable model generation.\n\nLooking at the facts and results, the simplest approach is that there are rules that generate new facts based on existing ones. The minimal set of rules would be:\n\nd4(X) :- d0(X).\nd1(X) :- d0(X).  \nd4(X) :- d2(X).\nd1(X) :- d2(X).\nd4(X) :- d3(X).\nd1(X) :- d3(X).\n\nBut since we have d4(o0) and d4(o2) in the result, and these aren't in the original facts, there must be rules that generate these.\n\nThe minimal rules that would produce this stable model are:\n\nd4(X) :- d0(X).\nd4(X) :- d2(X).\nd1(X) :- d0(X).\nd1(X) :- d3(X).\nd4(X) :- d3(X).\nd0(X) :- d1(X).\n\nWait, this is getting complex. Let me think of this differently.\n\nThe most straightforward minimal rules that would generate the stable model are:\n\nd4(X) :- d0(X).\nd1(X) :- d0(X).\nd4(X) :- d2(X).\nd1(X) :- d2(X).\nd4(X) :- d3(X).\nd1(X) :- d3(X).\n\nBut this would generate too many facts. \n\nLooking more carefully at what's actually in the stable model vs original facts:\n- Original: d4(o1), d0(o1), d2(o3), d1(o0), d3(o2)\n- Result: d3(o2), d4(o1), d4(o0), d4(o2), d1(o0), d1(o1), d0(o1), d2(o3)\n\nThe new facts are: d4(o0), d4(o2), d1(o1)\n\nSo the minimal rules would be:\nd4(X) :- d0(X).\nd4(X) :- d2(X). \nd1(X) :- d0(X).\nd1(X) :- d3(X).\n\nBut this doesn't seem right either since d0(o1) is in both, and d4(o0) should be generated by d4(X) :- d0(X) when d0(o0) exists, but d0(o0) doesn't exist.\n\nLet me reconsider the stable model generation. The rules must be such that when we compute the stable model, we get exactly the listed facts.\n\nThe minimal rules are:\n\nd4(X) :- d0(X).\nd1(X) :- d0(X).\nd4(X) :- d2(X).\nd1(X) :- d2(X).\nd4(X) :- d3(X).\nd1(X :- d3(X).",
