The most natural rule would be something like:\n- d3(X) :- d2(X)\n\nThis would derive d3(o3) from d2(o3).\n\nLooking at the pattern, I need to determine what rules are necessary to generate all the predicates in the stable model. Since d3(o3) is the only new predicate, and it's derived from d2(o3), the minimal rule set would be:\n\nd3(X) :- d2(X).",
