If d2(o1) is true, then d3(o1) would not be derived from d1(o1) and not d2(o1).\n\nLet me try:\nd1(X) :- d0(X).\nd3(X) :- d1(X).\n\nThis would derive d1(o1) from d0(o1), and then d3(o1) from d1(o1).\n\nBut I need to check if this works with the stable model. The stable model has d2(o1) as true, so if d3(o1) depends on not d2(o1), then d3(o1) would not be in the model.\n\nLooking more carefully, I think the rules must be:\nd1(X) :- d0(X).\nd2(X) :- d0(X).\nd3(X) :- d1(X).\n\nBut that would make d2(o1) true (from d0(o1)), which is consistent.\n\nActually, let me be more precise. The stable model has d2(o1) as true, so any rule that would make d2(o1) false would not be used.\n\nThe minimal rules are:\nd1(X) :- d0(X).\nd3(X) :- d1(X).\n\nThese rules, together with the given facts, would produce the stable model shown.",
