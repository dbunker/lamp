From the facts, d0(o3) and d0(o2) are directly given, so no rule needed for these.\n2. d1(o4) is given as a fact, so no rule needed.\n3. d2(o3) appears in the model but not in the facts, so there must be a rule generating it.\n4. d3(o3) is both given as a fact and appears in the model, so no rule needed.\n\nFor d2(o3) to be generated, I need a rule of the form:\nd2(o3) :- some_condition\n\nLooking at the pattern and what's available, the most likely rule would be:\nd2(X) :- d3(X)\n\nThis would generate d2(o3) from the fact d3(o3).\n\nLet me verify this is minimal - we need:\n- A rule to generate d2(o3) from d3(o3)\n- No other rules are needed since all other atoms are either facts or can be derived from the given facts\n\nd2(X) :- d3(X)",
