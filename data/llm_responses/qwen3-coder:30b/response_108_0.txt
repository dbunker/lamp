    "content": "Looking at the given facts and stable model, I need to deduce the minimal set of rules that would generate this result.\n\nGiven facts:\n- d0(o3)\n- d2(o0) \n- d4(o2)\n- d3(o2)\n\nStable model result:\n- d0(o3)\n- d1(o3)\n- d2(o0)\n- d4(o2)\n- d3(o2)\n\nThe key insight is that d1(o3) appears in the stable model but not in the original facts. This means there must be a rule that derives d1(o3) from the existing facts.\n\nSince d1(o3) is derived from d0(o3), and d0(o3) is a fact, the minimal rule would be:\n\nd1(X) :- d0(X).\n\nLet me verify this makes sense:\n- We have d0(o3) as a fact\n- Rule d1(X) :- d0(X) derives d1(o3)\n- All other facts (d2(o0), d4(o2), d3(o2)) remain as they are\n- No other rules are needed since d1(o3) is the only derived fact\n\nd1(X) :- d0(X).",
