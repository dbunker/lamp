For d0(o1) and d0(o3) to be true, there must be rules that derive them\n2. For d3(o1) and d3(o3) to be true, there must be rules that derive them\n3. The facts d2(o1), d2(o3), d1(o3), d1(o1) are given\n\nLooking at the pattern, it appears that:\n- d0(X) might be derived from some condition\n- d3(X) might be derived from some condition\n- d1 and d2 are base facts\n\nSince we want the minimal set of rules, let me consider that:\n- d0(X) and d3(X) are derived from some conditions\n- The simplest rules would be those that directly use the given facts\n\nThe minimal rules that would generate this stable model are:\n\n```\nd0(X) :- d1(X).\nd3(X) :- d2(X).\n```\n\nThese rules are minimal because:\n1. They use the existing facts to derive new predicates\n2. They're the simplest possible rules that could generate the observed stable model\n3. No other rules are needed to produce the exact set of atoms shown in the stable model",
