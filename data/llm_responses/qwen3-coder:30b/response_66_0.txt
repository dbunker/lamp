From d0(o1) in facts, and d0(o1) in model - this suggests d0 is defined by some rule\n2. From d2(o0) and d2(o1) in model, and d2(o0), d2(o1) in facts - these are already given\n3. From d3(o0) and d3(o1) in model, but not in facts - these must be derived\n4. From d1(o0) and d1(o1) in model - these must be derived\n\nLooking at the pattern, it appears that:\n- d3(X) can be derived from d0(X) and d1(X) \n- d1(X) can be derived from d2(X) and d3(X)\n- d2(X) can be derived from d0(X) and d1(X)\n\nLet me try to find minimal rules that generate the exact stable model:\n\nThe minimal rules needed are:\n```\nd1(X) :- d2(X), not d3(X).\nd2(X) :- d0(X), not d1(X).\nd3(X) :- d0(X), not d1(X).\nd3(X) :- d2(X), not d1(X).\nd1(X) :- d0(X), not d2(X).\n```\n\nWait, let me reconsider more carefully. Looking at what's actually in the model vs facts:\n\nThe key insight is that we need rules that can generate the missing values (d3(o0), d3(o1), d1(o0), d1(o1)) from the given facts.\n\n```\nd1(X) :- d2(X).\nd2(X) :- d0(X).\nd3(X) :- d0(X).\nd3(X) :- d2(X).\n```",
