The stable model includes d4(o0) and d4(o4), which means there must be rules that generate these.\n\nIf we have a rule like: d4(X) :- d2(X) \nThen d4(o4) would be generated from d2(o4) \u2713\n\nIf we have a rule like: d4(X) :- d3(X) \nThen d4(o4) would be generated from d3(o4) \u2713\n\nBut we also need d4(o0) to be generated from d4(o0) itself or from some rule.\n\nSince we have d4(o0) in facts, it's already true.\n\nLet me think of this differently - the minimal rules that would generate this stable model:\n\nd4(X) :- d2(X).\nd4(X) :- d3(X). \nd0(X) :- d0(X). [identity rule, but this is just saying if d0(X) then d0(X)]\nd2(X) :- d2(X). [identity rule]\n\nActually, since we want minimal rules, let's think of it this way:\n\nThe stable model is: d4(o0) d4(o4) d0(o3) d2(o4) d3(o4)\n\nThe minimal set of rules that would generate this:\n- d4(X) :- d3(X). [generates d4(o4) from d3(o4)]\n- d4(X) :- d2(X). [generates d4(o4) from d2(o4)]\n- d0(X) :- d0(X). [but this is just identity]\n- d2(X) :- d2(X). [identity]\n\nWait, I need to be more precise about what rules generate what.\n\nThe most minimal rules that would generate this stable model are:\n\nd4(X) :- d3(X).\nd4(X) :- d2(X).\n\nThese two rules, combined with the given facts, would produce the stable model shown. The other facts (d0(o3) and d2(o4)) are either base facts or already included in the result.\n\nd4(X) :- d3(X).\nd4(X) :- d2(X).",
