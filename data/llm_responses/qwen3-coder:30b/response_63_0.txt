Looking at the pattern and the fact that d1(o1) is present, a likely rule would be:\n\nd2(X) :- d1(X).\n\nThis would generate d2(o1) from d1(o1).\n\nLet me verify this is minimal by checking if any other rules are needed:\n- d0 facts are already given\n- d1(o1) is given\n- d3(o1) is given\n- d2(o1) needs to be generated from d1(o1)\n\nThe minimal rules needed are:\nd2(X) :- d1(X).",
