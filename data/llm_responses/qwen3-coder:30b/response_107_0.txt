From the facts, d1(o3) and d4(o0) are already given\n2. d4(o1) appears in the model but not in the facts - so there must be a rule generating it\n3. d2(o3) appears in the model but not in the facts - so there must be a rule generating it\n4. d3(o3), d3(o0), d3(o1) are in both facts and model\n\nThe minimal rules needed are:\n\n```\nd4(X) :- d1(X).\nd2(X) :- d3(X).\nd4(X) :- d3(X), not d4(X).\n```\n\nWait, let me reconsider more carefully. Looking at what's actually generated:\n\n- d1(o3) is given\n- d4(o0) is given  \n- d4(o1) must be generated from d3(o1) (since d3(o1) is in facts but d4(o1) is in model)\n- d2(o3) must be generated from d3(o3)\n- d4(o1) could also be generated from d1(o1) if d1(o1) were in the model\n\nActually, I need to think about this more systematically. Looking at the stable model, I need to find the minimal set of rules that, when combined with the given facts, produce exactly that stable model.\n\n```\nd4(X) :- d3(X), not d4(X).\nd2(X) :- d3(X).\n```",
