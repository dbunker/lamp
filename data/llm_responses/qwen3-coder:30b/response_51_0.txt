The simplest rule that would generate d3(o0) from the given facts is:\n\nd3(X) :- d2(X), d1(X)\n\nThis rule would derive d3(o0) because d2(o0) and d1(o0) are both facts.\n\nBut wait - I need to be more careful. Looking at what's actually needed to generate the stable model, I should consider that we might need rules that are minimal and sufficient.\n\nThe most straightforward minimal rule that would generate d3(o0) from the given facts is:\n\nd3(X) :- d2(X), d1(X)\n\nThis rule, together with the existing facts, would generate the stable model shown.\n\nd3(X) :- d2(X), d1(X)",
