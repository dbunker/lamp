Looking at the structure, it seems like there might be rules like:\n- d4(X) :- d2(X) \n- d3(X) :- d0(X), d1(X)\n- d2(X) :- d4(X) (but this would create cycles)\n\nActually, let me reconsider the minimal set needed:\n- d0(o0) is given\n- d1(o0) is given  \n- d2(o3) is given\n- d3(o0) must be derived\n- d4(o0) is given\n- d4(o3) is given\n\nThe minimal rules needed are:\n1. d3(X) :- d0(X), d1(X)\n2. d4(X) :- d2(X) (to generate d4(o3) from d2(o3))\n\nWait, let me reconsider the stable model more carefully.\n\nActually, looking at the facts and what's generated, I think the rules are:\n1. d3(X) :- d0(X), d1(X)  \n2. d4(X) :- d2(X) \n\nBut let me double-check if d4(o0) can be derived from d2(o3) and other rules.\n\nSince we're given d4(o0) and d2(o3), and d4(o3) is also given, and d0(o0) and d1(o0) are given, the minimal rules are:\n\nd3(X) :- d0(X), d1(X).\nd4(X) :- d2(X).",
