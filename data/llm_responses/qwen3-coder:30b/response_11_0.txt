From d1(o0) and d1(o2) in the facts, and both appearing in the model, these seem to be direct facts or derived from rules.\n\n2. d0(o1) appears in the model but not in the facts, so there must be a rule generating it.\n\n3. d3(o2) appears in the model but not in the facts, so there must be a rule generating it.\n\n4. d0(o0) appears in both facts and model.\n\nLooking at the pattern, I can deduce:\n- d0(o1) likely comes from a rule like: d0(X) :- d2(X)\n- d3(o2) likely comes from a rule like: d3(X) :- d1(X)\n- d0(o0) is already given\n- d1(o0) and d1(o2) are already given\n- d2(o1) is already given\n\nThe minimal rules needed are:\n```\nd0(X) :- d2(X).\nd3(X) :- d1(X).\n```",
