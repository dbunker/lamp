For d2 to hold for o2, o3, o0: This suggests rules like `d2(X) :- d1(X)` or `d2(X) :- d0(X)` or similar conditions.\n\n2. For d1 to hold for o3, o0: This suggests rules like `d1(X) :- d0(X)` or `d1(X) :- d3(X)`.\n\n3. For d0 to hold for o2: This is already given as a fact.\n\nLooking at the relationships, the most logical rules would be:\n- `d2(X) :- d1(X)` (if d1 holds, then d2 holds)\n- `d1(X) :- d0(X)` (if d0 holds, then d1 holds)\n- `d2(X) :- d3(X)` (if d3 holds, then d2 holds)\n\nBut let me reconsider the minimal set needed to generate exactly the stable model:\n\nThe rules that would generate this stable model are:\n\nd2(X) :- d1(X).\nd1(X) :- d0(X).  \nd2(X) :- d3(X).\n\nThese three rules, combined with the given facts, would produce the exact stable model shown.",
