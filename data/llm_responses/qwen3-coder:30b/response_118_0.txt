From d1(o0) appearing in the result, I need a rule that derives d1(o0) from the facts.\n2. From d4(o1) and d4(o3) appearing in both facts and result, these are likely direct facts or derived from rules.\n3. d2(o1) appears in result but not in facts - needs a rule.\n4. d0(o1) appears in result but not in facts - needs a rule.\n\nLooking at the stable model, I can see:\n- d1(o0) is already a fact\n- d4(o1) and d4(o3) are facts\n- d2(o1) and d0(o1) are derived\n\nThe minimal rules that would generate this are:\n\n```\nd2(X) :- d3(X), not d4(X).\nd0(X) :- d1(X), not d2(X).\nd4(X) :- d3(X), not d0(X).\n```\n\nWait, let me reconsider more carefully. Looking at the stable model, I need to find rules that would make d2(o1) and d0(o1) true given the facts.\n\nActually, looking more systematically:\n- d1(o0) is a fact\n- d4(o1) and d4(o3) are facts  \n- d2(o1) must be derived\n- d0(o1) must be derived\n- d3(o1) is a fact\n\nThe minimal rules are:\n```\nd2(X) :- d3(X), not d4(X).\nd0(X) :- d1(X), not d2(X).\nd4(X) :- d3(X), not d0(X).\n```\n\nBut since d4(o1) and d4(o3) are facts, and d3(o1) is a fact, I need to think about what would actually be required to generate d2(o1) and d0(o1).\n\n```\nd2(X) :- d3(X), not d4(X).\nd0(X) :- d1(X), not d2(X).\n```",
