Looking at what's actually needed:\n\nSince d3(o2) appears in the result but not in the facts, and it's the only new predicate, I need a rule that generates d3(o2).\n\nLooking at the relationships:\n- d0(o1) and d0(o2) are in both facts and result\n- d2(o1) is in facts and result  \n- d4(o4) is in facts and result\n- d3(o2) is in result only\n\nThe minimal rules needed are:\n```\nd3(X) :- d0(X), not d2(X).\nd0(X) :- d2(X).\nd2(X) :- d4(X).\nd4(X) :- d0(X).\n```\n\nActually, let me think more systematically. The simplest approach that generates exactly what we need:\n\n```\nd3(X) :- d0(X), not d2(X).\nd0(X) :- d2(X).\nd2(X) :- d4(X).\nd4(X) :- d0(X).\n```",
