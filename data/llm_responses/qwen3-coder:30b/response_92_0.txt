    "content": "Looking at the given facts and the resulting stable model, I need to deduce the minimal set of rules that would generate this model.\n\nGiven facts:\n- d3(o0)\n- d1(o1) \n- d4(o2)\n- d3(o2)\n- d2(o2)\n\nResulting stable model:\n- d3(o0) d3(o2) d1(o1) d2(o2) d2(o0) d4(o2)\n\nLet me analyze what rules would be needed:\n\n1. From d3(o0) and d3(o2) in the facts, and d3(o0) and d3(o2) in the model, I need rules that can generate d3(o0) and d3(o2).\n\n2. From d1(o1) in facts and d1(o1) in model - this is straightforward.\n\n3. From d2(o2) in facts and d2(o2) in model - this is straightforward.\n\n4. d2(o0) appears in the model but not in the facts - this must be generated by a rule.\n\n5. d4(o2) appears in both facts and model - this is straightforward.\n\nThe key insight is that d2(o0) must be generated by a rule. Looking at the pattern, it likely comes from a rule like:\n- d2(X) :- d3(X)\n\nThis would generate d2(o0) and d2(o2) from d3(o0) and d3(o2).\n\nLet me check if there are other rules needed:\n- d4(o2) is already in the facts, so no rule needed for that\n- d1(o1) is already in the facts, so no rule needed for that\n- d3(o0) and d3(o2) are in facts, so no rules needed for those\n- d2(o0) needs to be generated, likely from d3(o0) via a rule\n\nThe minimal set of rules would be:\n```\nd2(X) :- d3(X).\n```",
