Since d4(o2) and d4(o1) are in the model and appear in the facts, they might be direct facts or derived from rules\n2. d3(o1) and d3(o0) are in both facts and model, so they could be direct facts or derived\n3. d2(o1) and d2(o0) must be derived from rules\n4. d1(o2) and d1(o1) must be derived from rules\n5. d0(o1) and d0(o0) must be derived from rules\n\nLooking at the pattern, it appears there's a hierarchy where:\n- d0(X) is derived from d1(X) \n- d1(X) is derived from d2(X)\n- d2(X) is derived from d3(X)\n- d3(X) is derived from d4(X)\n\nBut since d3(o1) and d3(o0) appear in both facts and model, and d4(o1) and d4(o2) appear in facts, let me reconsider.\n\nThe minimal rules needed are:\n\nd0(X) :- d1(X).\nd1(X) :- d2(X).  \nd2(X) :- d3(X).\nd3(X) :- d4(X).",
