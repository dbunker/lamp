Looking at the stable model, I need to think about what rules would generate the additional facts (d1(o3) and d0(o3)) while preserving the existing ones.\n\nThe minimal set of rules that would generate this stable model is:\n\nd0(X) :- d2(X).\nd1(X) :- d3(X), not d0(X).\nd1(X) :- d4(X), not d0(X).",
