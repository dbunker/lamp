Since d0(o4) is given as a fact, no rule is needed for this.\n2. Since d3(o4) and d3(o1) appear in both facts and result, these could be facts or derived.\n3. Since d1(o4) appears in both, this could be a fact or derived.\n4. Since d2(o1) appears in the result but not in the facts, it must be derived.\n\nLooking at the pattern, the most likely rules are:\n- d2(o1) can be derived from d3(o1) and some negation\n- d3(o4) and d3(o1) might be derived from d0(o4) and d1(o4) with some conditions\n- d1(o4) might be derived from d0(o4) with some conditions\n\nThe minimal rules that would generate this result are:\n\nd2(X) :- d3(X), not d1(X), not d0(X).\nd3(X) :- d0(X), not d1(X).\nd1(X) :- d0(X), not d2(X).",
