    "content": "Looking at the given facts and stable model, I need to deduce the minimal set of rules that would generate this result.\n\nGiven facts:\n- d0(o1)\n- d0(o2) \n- d3(o1)\n- d2(o0)\n\nStable model result:\n- d0(o1) d0(o2) d3(o1) d1(o2) d2(o0)\n\nI can see that:\n- d0(o1) and d0(o2) are already in the facts and remain in the model\n- d3(o1) is in the facts and remains in the model  \n- d2(o0) is in the facts and remains in the model\n- d1(o2) appears in the model but not in the original facts\n\nThis means d1(o2) must be derived from some rule. Since we have d0(o2) in the facts, and d1(o2) appears in the model, there must be a rule that derives d1 from d0.\n\nLooking at the pattern, I need rules that can generate:\n1. d1(o2) from d0(o2) (since d0(o2) is in facts but d1(o2) is in model)\n2. The other predicates should be derivable from existing facts or rules\n\nThe minimal rules needed are:\n```\nd1(X) :- d0(X).\nd2(X) :- d2(X).  % This would be redundant, but since d2(o0) is in facts, we need a rule that keeps it\nd3(X) :- d3(X).  % This would be redundant, but since d3(o1) is in facts, we need a rule that keeps it\n```\n\nWait, let me reconsider. Since d0(o1), d0(o2), d3(o1), d2(o0) are given as facts, and d1(o2) appears in the model, there must be a rule that generates d1(o2) from d0(o2).\n\nThe minimal set of rules is:\n```\nd1(X) :- d0(X).\n```",
