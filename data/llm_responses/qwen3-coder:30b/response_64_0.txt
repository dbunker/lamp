From d3(o0) in facts and d3(o3) in result, I need a rule that derives d3(o3)\n2. From d2(o3) in result, I need a rule that derives d2(o3)\n3. d4(o3) appears in both facts and result\n4. d0(o0) and d0(o3) appear in both facts and result\n\nLooking at the pattern, I can deduce these minimal rules:\n\n```\nd3(X) :- d0(X).\nd2(X) :- d0(X).\nd4(X) :- d4(X).\nd0(X) :- d0(X).\n```\n\nWait, let me reconsider more carefully. The stable model includes d3(o3) which wasn't in the original facts, so there must be a rule that generates it from d0(o3).\n\n```\nd3(X) :- d0(X).\nd2(X) :- d0(X).\nd4(X) :- d4(X).\n```",
