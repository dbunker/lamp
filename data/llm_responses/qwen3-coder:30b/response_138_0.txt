    "content": "Looking at the given facts and stable model, I need to deduce the minimal set of rules that would generate this result.\n\nGiven facts:\n- d3(o4). d1(o4). d4(o3). d3(o3). d3(o1)\n\nStable model result:\n- d3(o4) d3(o3) d3(o1) d4(o3) d4(o4) d4(o1) d1(o4) d0(o4)\n\nLet me analyze what rules are needed:\n\n1. From d3(o4), d3(o3), d3(o1) in facts, these are directly derived\n2. From d4(o3) in result, and d4(o3) in facts, this is directly derived  \n3. From d4(o4) and d4(o1) in result, these must be derived from rules\n4. From d0(o4) in result, this must be derived from rules\n\nLooking at the pattern, it appears that:\n- d4(X) can be derived from d3(X) \n- d0(X) can be derived from d1(X)\n- d4(X) can also be derived from d1(X) (since d4(o4) appears in result)\n\nLet me work backwards to find minimal rules:\n\nRules needed:\n1. d4(X) :- d3(X).  (This explains d4(o3) from d3(o3))\n2. d4(X) :- d1(X).  (This explains d4(o4) from d1(o4))  \n3. d0(X) :- d1(X).  (This explains d0(o4) from d1(o4))\n\nChecking if this is minimal:\n- With rules 1 and 2, we get d4(o3) from d3(o3) and d4(o4) from d1(o4)\n- With rule 3, we get d0(o4) from d1(o4)\n- We also need d4(o1) to be generated somehow\n- Since d4(o1) appears in result but d1(o1) is not in facts, it must be generated by a rule\n- We can add: d4(X) :- d3(X). (to generate d4(o1) from d3(o1))\n\nActually, let me reconsider more carefully:\n\nThe minimal set of rules is:\nd4(X) :- d3(X).\nd4(X) :- d1(X).  \nd0(X) :- d1(X).",
