Since d1(o0) appears in the result and was given as a fact, no rule is needed for this.\n2. Since d0(o2) appears in the result and was given as a fact, no rule is needed for this.\n3. Since d3(o2) appears in the result and was given as a fact, no rule is needed for this.\n4. Since d2(o0) appears in the result and was given as a fact, no rule is needed for this.\n5. Since d3(o0) appears in the result but wasn't given as a fact, there must be a rule that derives it.\n\nFor d3(o0) to be derived, there must be a rule like:\nd3(X) :- some_condition(X)\n\nLooking at the pattern and the fact that d2(o0) is given, a possible rule could be:\nd3(X) :- d2(X)\n\nBut let me check if there are other dependencies. Since d3(o0) is derived and d2(o0) is given, the rule d3(X) :- d2(X) would work.\n\nHowever, I need to be more careful - I need to find the minimal set that generates exactly the stable model.\n\nThe minimal rules needed are:\nd3(X) :- d2(X)\n\nThis single rule, combined with the given facts, would generate d3(o0) from d2(o0), which is exactly what we need to produce the stable model.\n\nd3(X) :- d2(X)",
