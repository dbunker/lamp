Since we need to find minimal rules, let me consider what could generate d4(o3).\n\nLooking at the pattern, it seems like d4(o3) might be derivable from d1(o3) and some other condition. \n\nThe most minimal rules that could explain this are:\n1. d4(X) :- d1(X)  (if d1(o3) generates d4(o3))\n2. d4(X) :- d2(X)  (if d2(o2) generates d4(o2) - but d4(o2) is already given)\n3. d4(X) :- d4(X)  (this would be circular, not minimal)\n\nActually, looking more carefully, the simplest explanation is that d4(o3) is generated by a rule that uses d1(o3) as a premise.\n\nThe minimal rules are:\nd4(X) :- d1(X).\nd4(X) :- d2(X).",
