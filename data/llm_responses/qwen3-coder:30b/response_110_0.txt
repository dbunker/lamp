Since d4(o0) is in both facts and stable model, and d1(o0) is in both, and d0(o2) is in both, these are likely facts rather than derived.\n\nThe minimal rules needed are:\n1. d3(X) :- d2(X) (to derive d3(o1) from d2(o1))\n\nLet me verify this is sufficient:\n- d2(o1) is given as fact\n- From rule d3(X) :- d2(X), we get d3(o1)\n- All other atoms are given as facts\n\n```\nd3(X) :- d2(X).\n```",
