Since d1(o3) appears in the result but not in the facts, there must be a rule like:\n   d1(X) :- some_condition(X)\n\n2. Looking at the pattern, if we have d0(o1) and d2(o3) in the facts, and we get d1(o3) in the result, a plausible rule would be:\n   d1(X) :- d2(X), not d0(X)\n\nBut let me reconsider more systematically. The stable model contains d1(o3) which wasn't in the original facts, so there must be a rule that derives it.\n\nLooking at the structure, a minimal set of rules that would work is:\n\nd1(X) :- d2(X).\nd1(X) :- d0(X).\n\nWait, that's not right because d1(o3) would be derived from d2(o3) and d1(o1) would be derived from d0(o1).\n\nActually, let me think more carefully about what's needed to get d1(o3) in the final model:\n\nThe simplest rule that would generate d1(o3) from the given facts is:\nd1(X) :- d2(X).\n\nBut we also need d1(o1) to be generated from d0(o1). \n\nSo the minimal set of rules would be:\n\nd1(X) :- d2(X).\nd1(X) :- d0(X).",
