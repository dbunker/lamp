From the facts, I have d0(o1), d4(o0), d2(o1), d1(o1)\n2. The stable model includes d3(o1) which wasn't in the original facts\n3. The stable model includes d4(o0) which was in the facts, so it must be derived or confirmed\n\nSince d3(o1) appears in the stable model but not in the original facts, there must be a rule that derives it. The most straightforward rule would be:\n```\nd3(X) :- d1(X).\n```\n\nSince d1(o1) is in the facts, this would derive d3(o1).\n\nLooking at the stable model, all the d predicates that appear are already in the facts or derived, so I need to check if there are any other rules that might be needed.\n\nThe simplest rule that would work with the given facts and produce the stable model is:\n```\nd3(X) :- d1(X).\n```\n\nThis is the minimal rule needed to derive d3(o1) from d1(o1), which appears in both the facts and stable model.\n\n```\nd3(X) :- d1(X).\n```",
