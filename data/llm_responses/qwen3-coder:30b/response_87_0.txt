For d4(o2) to appear in the model, there must be a rule that derives it\n2. For d3(o2) to appear, there must be a rule deriving it\n3. For d2(o2) to appear, there must be a rule deriving it\n4. The d1 facts are already given as facts\n\nLooking at the pattern, it seems like there are rules of the form:\n- d2(X) :- d1(X), not d3(X), not d4(X), etc.\n- d3(X) :- d2(X), not d4(X), etc.\n- d4(X) :- d1(X), not d3(X), etc.\n\nBut since d4(o2) is already a fact, and appears in the model, it might be derived from some rule.\n\nThe minimal set of rules that would generate this stable model:\n\n```\nd2(X) :- d1(X), not d3(X).\nd3(X) :- d2(X), not d4(X).  \nd4(X) :- d1(X).\n```",
