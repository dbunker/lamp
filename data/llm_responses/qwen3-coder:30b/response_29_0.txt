From the facts, I can see d0(o3), d0(o1), d2(o0), d2(o3), d3(o3) are already present\n2. d1(o1) appears in the result but not in the facts, so there must be a rule that derives it\n3. The facts include d3(o3), so d3(o3) is already true\n\nLooking at the pattern, I need rules that can generate:\n- d1(o1) from some condition\n- The existing facts should be derivable from rules\n\nSince d1(o1) appears in the result but not in the facts, it must be derived by a rule. Looking at the structure, if there's a rule like:\nd1(X) :- d0(X), not d2(X), not d3(X)\n\nThis would derive d1(o1) because d0(o1) is true and d2(o1) and d3(o1) are false.\n\nHowever, I notice that d0(o1) is already in the facts, and d2(o1) and d3(o1) are not in the facts (so they're false in the stable model).\n\nSo I need rules like:\n- d0(X) :- d0(X) (identity rule)\n- d2(X) :- d2(X) (identity rule)  \n- d3(X) :- d3(X) (identity rule)\n- d1(X) :- d0(X), not d2(X), not d3(X)\n\nBut since we want minimal rules and we have facts, let me reconsider...\n\nActually, looking more carefully, I think the minimal rules needed are:\n\nd1(X) :- d0(X), not d2(X), not d3(X).\nd0(X) :- d0(X).\nd2(X) :- d2(X).  \nd3(X) :- d3(X).\n\nBut since we want the minimal set that generates this specific stable model, and we see that d1(o1) must be derived from the facts, the most direct rule would be:\n\nd1(X) :- d0(X), not d2(X), not d3(X).\n\nHowever, I should also include rules to ensure that d0, d2, d3 facts are properly handled. Since the facts are given, and we want the minimal set of rules that can generate the result, the key rule is:\n\nd1(X) :- d0(X), not d2(X), not d3(X).\n\nd1(X) :- d0(X), not d2(X), not d3(X).\nd0(X) :- d0(X).\nd2(X) :- d2(X).\nd3(X) :- d3(X).",
