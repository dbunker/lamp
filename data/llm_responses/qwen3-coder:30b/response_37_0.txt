From the facts, I have d2(o1), d0(o1), d1(o1), d0(o4)\n2. The stable model includes d3(o1) which must be derived from some rule\n3. The stable model includes d0(o1), d0(o4), d2(o1), d1(o1) - these are either facts or derived\n\nLooking at the pattern, I need rules that can derive:\n- d3(o1) from some condition\n- Possibly other predicates\n\nThe minimal set of rules that would generate this stable model:\n\n```\nd3(o1) :- d1(o1), not d2(o1).\nd0(o1) :- d2(o1), not d3(o1).\nd0(o4) :- d0(o4).\nd1(o1) :- d1(o1).\nd2(o1) :- d2(o1).\n```\n\nWait, let me reconsider more carefully. The stable model includes d3(o1) which must be derived, so I need a rule that can generate it. Since d1(o1) is in the facts and stable model, I need a rule like:\n\n```\nd3(o1) :- d1(o1), not d2(o1).\nd0(o1) :- d0(o1).\nd0(o4) :- d0(o4).\nd1(o1) :- d1(o1).\nd2(o1) :- d2(o1).\n```\n\nActually, looking more systematically at what's needed:\n- d0(o1) is in both facts and stable model\n- d0(o4) is in both facts and stable model  \n- d1(o1) is in both facts and stable model\n- d2(o1) is in both facts and stable model\n- d3(o1) is in stable model but not facts\n\nSo I need a rule to derive d3(o1):\n```\nd3(o1) :- d1(o1), not d2(o1).\n```",
