Since d3(o0) is the only new predicate in the stable model that isn't directly given, I need a rule that can derive it from existing facts.\n\nThe most straightforward rule would be:\nd3(X) :- d1(X), not d2(X), not d0(X), not d4(X)\n\nBut since d1(o0) is true and d2(o0) is true, this wouldn't work.\n\nLooking more carefully, if d3(o0) is derived from d1(o0), then a rule like:\nd3(X) :- d1(X)\n\nwould work, assuming there are no other conditions that would prevent this.\n\nHowever, since d1(o0) is already in the facts and d3(o0) appears in the model, and there's no explicit rule given, the minimal set of rules that could generate this is:\n\nd3(X) :- d1(X).\n\nThis rule would generate d3(o0) from d1(o0), which is consistent with the stable model.\n\nBut wait - I need to think about this more systematically. The stable model includes d3(o0) which wasn't in the original facts. This means there must be a rule that derives it. \n\nLooking at what would be needed:\n- d1(o0) is given\n- d3(o0) is derived from d1(o0) \n- This suggests d3(X) :- d1(X) is a rule\n\nd3(X) :- d1(X).",
