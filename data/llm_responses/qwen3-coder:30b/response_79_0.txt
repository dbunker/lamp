Looking at the pattern, it seems like d3(o2) could be derived from d2(o2) and some other condition.\n\nThe minimal rules needed are:\n\nd3(X) :- d2(X).\nd0(X) :- d0(X). [This is redundant, but if we need to include it to maintain the pattern]\nd2(X) :- d2(X). [This is also redundant]\n\nActually, looking more carefully, since d3(o2) appears in the final model and d2(o2) is given, the rule is likely:\n\nd3(X) :- d2(X).\n\nBut we also need to ensure d0(o2) and d4(o0) are preserved, and d2(o0) and d2(o2) are preserved.\n\nSince d0(o2) and d4(o0) are in the stable model but not in the original facts, they must be derived from rules. However, the facts given are the only facts, so these must be derived from rules that don't require additional facts.\n\nThe most logical minimal set of rules that would generate the stable model is:\n\nd3(X) :- d2(X).\nd0(X) :- d0(X).\nd4(X) :- d4(X).\nd2(X) :- d2(X).\n\nBut since we're looking for minimal rules and d0(o2), d4(o0), d2(o0), d2(o2) are all given as facts, and only d3(o2) is derived, the key rule is:\n\nd3(X) :- d2(X).\n\nHowever, looking at the stable model more carefully, if we want to include all the facts that appear in the final model, we need rules that would generate d3(o2) from d2(o2). \n\nThe minimal set of rules is:\n\nd3(X) :- d2(X).",
