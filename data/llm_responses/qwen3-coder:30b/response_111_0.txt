The other predicates are already given or derived\n\nThe minimal set of rules that would generate this stable model is:\n\nd3(X) :- d1(X), not d2(X), not d4(X).\nd1(X) :- d2(X), not d3(X), not d4(X).\nd2(X) :- d4(X), not d1(X), not d3(X).\n\nWait, let me reconsider this more carefully. Since d1(o3) appears in the stable model but not in the facts, there must be a rule that generates it. \n\nLooking at the facts and what's needed to generate the stable model, I need:\n\nd3(o4) :- d1(o4), not d2(o4), not d4(o4).\nd1(o3) :- d1(o4), not d2(o4), not d3(o4), not d4(o4).\n\nBut since we're looking for minimal rules, and the stable model contains d3(o4) which wasn't in the original facts, I need a rule that generates d3(o4) from d1(o4) and other conditions.\n\nActually, let me think about this differently - if we're looking for rules that are needed to generate the stable model, and d3(o4) appears in the stable model but not in the facts, then there must be a rule that derives it.\n\nThe minimal rules needed are:\n\nd3(X) :- d1(X), not d2(X), not d4(X).\nd1(X) :- d2(X), not d3(X), not d4(X).\nd2(X) :- d4(X), not d1(X), not d3(X).\n\nBut this seems circular. Let me think more systematically.\n\nSince d3(o4) appears in the stable model, there must be a rule that derives it. The most natural minimal rule would be:\n\nd3(X) :- d1(X), not d2(X), not d4(X).\n\nThis rule, when applied to o4, would generate d3(o4) since d1(o4) is true and d2(o4) and d4(o4) are false in the stable model.\n\nd3(X) :- d1(X), not d2(X), not d4(X).",
