Looking at the pattern and the fact that d2(o0) is already given, a minimal rule could be:\n- d2(X) :- d1(X)\n\nThis would derive d2(o1) from d1(o1), which is present in both facts and model.\n\nLet me verify this works:\n- d1(o1) is given\n- Rule: d2(X) :- d1(X) \n- This derives d2(o1)\n- d2(o0) is given directly\n- d0(o1) and d3(o1) are given directly\n\nThe minimal set of rules is:\n\nd2(X) :- d1(X).",
