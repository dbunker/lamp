Let me think about what would generate d2(o0) from the given information.\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the stable model, I notice that d2(o0) appears but d2(o1) also appears, and d4(o1) is given. \n\nThe minimal rules that would generate this model are:\n\nd2(X) :- d1(X).\nd2(X) :- d4(X).\nd4(X) :- d3(X).\n\nWait, that's not right either. Let me reconsider what rules are needed to generate the specific stable model.\n\nThe minimal set of rules is:\n\nd2(X) :- d1(X).\nd2(X) :- d4(X).\nd4(X) :- d3(X).",
