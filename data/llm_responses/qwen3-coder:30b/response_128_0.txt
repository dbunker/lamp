For d3(o4) and d3(o2) to appear, there must be rules that derive these\n2. For d1(o4) and d1(o2) to appear, there must be rules that derive these\n3. For d2(o3) to appear, there must be a rule that derives this\n4. For d4(o0) and d4(o2) to appear, there must be rules that derive these\n\nLooking at the stable model, I can see that:\n- d1(o4) and d1(o2) are derived (not in original facts)\n- d2(o3) is in both facts and model\n- d3(o4) and d3(o2) are in both facts and model  \n- d4(o0) and d4(o2) are in both facts and model\n\nThe most likely rules would be:\n- d1(X) :- d3(X), not d2(X) [to derive d1 from d3 where d2 doesn't hold]\n- d1(X) :- d4(X), not d2(X) [to derive d1 from d4 where d2 doesn't hold]\n- d2(X) :- d3(X), not d1(X) [to derive d2 from d3 where d1 doesn't hold]\n\nBut let me reconsider more carefully. Since d2(o3) appears in both facts and model, it's directly true. \n\nThe minimal rules needed to generate this stable model are:\n\nd1(X) :- d3(X), not d2(X).\nd1(X) :- d4(X), not d2(X).  \nd2(X) :- d3(X), not d1(X).\nd4(X) :- d4(X).  % Identity rule for d4\nd3(X) :- d3(X).  % Identity rule for d3\nd2(X) :- d2(X).  % Identity rule for d2",
