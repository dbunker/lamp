For d1(o3) to be true in the stable model, there must be a rule that derives d1(o3) from other predicates\n2. The facts d0(o1), d0(o4), d2(o3), d3(o3) are already given as facts\n3. The stable model shows d1(o3) is true, so there must be a rule like: d1(o3) :- some conditions\n\nLooking at the structure, a likely rule would be:\nd1(o3) :- d2(o3), d3(o3)\n\nThis would derive d1(o3) from the facts d2(o3) and d3(o3) that are already present.\n\nHowever, I need to be more careful. Since d0(o1) and d0(o4) are also facts, and d2(o3) and d3(o3) are facts, I should check if there are any other dependencies.\n\nThe minimal set of rules that would generate this stable model is:\n\nd1(o3) :- d2(o3), d3(o3).",
