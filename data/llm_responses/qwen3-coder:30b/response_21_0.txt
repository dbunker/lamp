Since d4(o2) appears in the result and was given as a fact, it likely comes from a rule like: d4(X) :- d4(X)\n2. Since d3(o3), d3(o1), d3(o2) appear in the result but weren't in the original facts, they must come from rules\n3. d2(o3) and d2(o1) are in both facts and result, so they might come from rules like d2(X) :- d2(X) or from rules with conditions\n4. d0(o4) is in both facts and result\n\nThe minimal rules needed are:\n- d3(X) :- d2(X) (generates d3(o3) and d3(o1) from d2(o3) and d2(o1))\n- d3(X) :- d4(X) (generates d3(o2) from d4(o2))\n- d3(X) :- d0(X) (generates d3(o4) from d0(o4), but this doesn't appear in result)\n- d2(X) :- d2(X) (to preserve existing d2 facts)\n- d4(X) :- d4(X) (to preserve existing d4 facts)\n- d0(X) :- d0(X) (to preserve existing d0 facts)\n\nActually, looking more carefully at the result, I see that d3(o4) doesn't appear, so the rule d3(X) :- d0(X) isn't needed.\n\nThe minimal set of rules that would generate this stable model:\n\nd3(X) :- d2(X).\nd3(X) :- d4(X). \nd2(X) :- d2(X).\nd4(X) :- d4(X).\nd0(X) :- d0(X).",
