    "content": "After analyzing the ASP facts and the stable model, I was able to deduce the minimal set of rules that explains the presence of each atom in the stable model. Here are the rules:\n\n```\nd0(o3) :- not d1(o3), not d2(o3).\nd1(o1) :- not d0(o1), not d2(o1).\nd2(o3) :- not d0(o3), not d1(o3).\nd0(o0) :- true.\nd0(o2) :- true.\n```\n\nThese rules capture the dependencies between the atoms in the stable model. For example, the rule `d0(o3) :- not d1(o3), not d2(o3)` says that `d0(o3)` is true if neither `d1(o3)` nor `d2(o3)` are true. This rules out the possibility of having a `d1` or `d2` atom with value `o3`, which would conflict with the presence of `d0(o3)` in the stable model.\n\nSimilarly, the rule `d2(o3) :- not d0(o3), not d1(o3)` says that `d2(o3)` is true if neither `d0(o3)` nor `d1(o3)` are true. This rules out the possibility of having a `d0` or `d1` atom with value `o3`, which would conflict with the presence of `d2(o3)` in the stable model.\n\nThe rules for `d0(o0)` and `d0(o2)` are trivial, since they don't have any dependencies other than being true themselves.",
