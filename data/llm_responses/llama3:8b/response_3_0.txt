Here are the rules:\n\n**Predicate d3(X) :-**\n\n* `d1(X), not d0(X)` (since `d3(o2)` and `d3(o1)`)\n\n**Predicate d1(X) :-**\n\n* `not d2(X)` (since `d1(o1)`)\n\n**Predicate d2(X) :-**\n\n* None needed, as there are no additional rules for `d2`\n\n**Predicate d0(X) :-**\n\n* None needed, as there are no additional rules for `d0`\n\nThese rules generate the stable model:\n\n`d3(o2), d1(o1), d3(o1), d2(o1), d2(o2), d0(o3)`\n\nPlease note that these rules are minimal in the sense that removing any of them would not result in the same stable model.",
