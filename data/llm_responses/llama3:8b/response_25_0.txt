    "content": "After analyzing the given facts and stable model, I deduced the following minimal set of rules:\n\n```\n:- not d3(o0).\n:- d2(X), d0(Y), X=Y.\n:- not d1(X), d3(X).\n:- d0(o2).\n```\n\nHere's a brief explanation for each rule:\n\n1. `:- not d3(o0).`: This rule ensures that o0 is not the target of any d3 relation, which is consistent with the stable model.\n2. `:- d2(X), d0(Y), X=Y.`: This rule states that if there's a d2 relationship with an object X, and there's a d0 relationship with the same object Y (i.e., X = Y), then it's allowed. This is because in the stable model, o3 has both d2 and d0 relationships.\n3. `:- not d1(X), d3(X).`: This rule ensures that if an object X has a d3 relationship, it cannot also have a d1 relationship. This is consistent with the fact that o3 has only one of these two relations in the stable model (d2).\n4. `:- d0(o2).`: This rule simply states that o2 has a d0 relationship, which is a given fact.\n\nThese rules together produce the same stable model as the original ASP program.",
