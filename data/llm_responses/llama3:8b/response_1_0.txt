    "content": "After analyzing the stable model and ASP facts, I found that the minimal set of rules is:\n\n```\n:- not d3(X), d1(X).\nd2(X) :- d3(X), d0(Y), not d1(Y).\n\noutput:\nd3(o1)\nd1(o1)\nd1(o3)\nd0(o3)\n```\n\nHere's a brief explanation for each rule:\n\n1. `:- not d3(X), d1(X).`: This rule states that if there is no `d3` fact and a `d1` fact, then it's inconsistent (due to the ASP fact `d2(o1)`). The negation of this rule ensures that when we have both `d3` and `d1` facts, they are consistent.\n2. `d2(X) :- d3(X), d0(Y), not d1(Y).`: This rule states that if there is a `d3` fact for some X, then there must be a `d0` fact for some Y (different from X) and no `d1` fact for Y. This ensures the consistency of the stable model.\n\nThese two rules capture the essential relationships between the predicates in the stable model.",
