    "content": "After analyzing the given ASP facts and stable model, I found that the minimal set of rules that can derive the stable model is:\n\n```\nd3(X) :- d2(X), not d0(X).\nd2(o0).\nd0(o0).\nd0(o2).\nd1(o4).\n```\n\nThese rules are the minimal set because they capture the essence of the given ASP facts and stable model. Each rule has a clear semantics: `d3` is used to derive new atoms, while `d2`, `d0`, and `d1` are used to propagate knowledge from the given facts.\n\nNote that the original rules may have more clauses or be written in a different form, but this minimal set of rules achieves the same stable model.",
