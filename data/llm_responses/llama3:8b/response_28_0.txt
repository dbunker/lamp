    "content": "A nice ASP problem!\n\nAfter analyzing the given facts and the resulting stable model, I have deduced the minimal set of rules that lead to the desired outcome.\n\nHere are the rules:\n\n```\nd3(X) :- d2(X), not d1(X).\nd2(o3) ; d2(o2).\nd0(X) :- d2(X).\nd1(o0).\n```\n\nThese rules, together with the given facts, will produce the stable model `d2(o3), d2(o2), d0(o3), d3(o3), d1(o0)`.\n\nHere's a brief explanation of each rule:\n\n1. `d3(X) :- d2(X), not d1(X).`: This rule says that if something is `d2`, it can only be `d3` if it's not already `d1`. This ensures that `o3` and `o2` are only assigned the highest priority (i.e., `d2`) or the next-lowest priority (`d3`).\n2. `d2(o3) ; d2(o2).`: This is a choice rule, which says that either `o3` or `o2` can be assigned `d2`. Since there are no other rules to contradict this, both `o3` and `o2` will be assigned `d2`.\n3. `d0(X) :- d2(X).`: This rule says that if something is `d2`, it must also be `d0`. Since all instances of `d2` are either `o3` or `o2`, they will also be assigned `d0`.\n4. `d1(o0).`: This is a fact, not a rule. It simply states that `o0` has priority `d1`.\n\nThese rules, combined with the given facts, produce the desired stable model.",
