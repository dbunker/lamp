    "content": "After analyzing the stable model, I deduced the following minimal set of rules:\n\n```\n:- not d3(X), d0(Y), Y != X.\nd0(o0).\nd1(o3).\n\n:- not d2(X), d0(Y), Y != X.\nd2(o0).\n\n:- not d3(X), d1(Y), Y != X.\nd3(o2).\n\n:- not d3(X), d3(Y), X != Y.\n```\n\nThese rules capture the dependencies between the predicates in the stable model. Each rule states that if a predicate is not true for some value, then another predicate must be true for that value (or vice versa). The minimal set of rules ensures that the stable model is preserved while eliminating unnecessary rules.\n\nNote that these rules are minimal because they do not include any redundant or contradictory information.",
