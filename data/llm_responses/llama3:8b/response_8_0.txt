Each rule is of the form `predicate_0(X) :- predicate_1(X), not predicate_2(X)`, where `predicate_0` is one of the predicates in the stable model, and `predicate_1` and `predicate_2` are other predicates that can be used to deduce `predicate_0`.\n\nThe first rule states that if a node has a label `d2`, it cannot have a label `d0`. The second three rules state that specific nodes (`o0`, `o1`, and `o3`) have the respective labels. The last two rules are additional constraints on the labels of `o0` and `o1`.\n\nThese rules together produce the given stable model: `d2(o0) d2(o1) d0(o3) d3(o0) d3(o1)`.",
